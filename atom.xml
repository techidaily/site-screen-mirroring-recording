This action will copy the screenshot to the clipboard so you can proceed to paste in your favorite photo editor. Holding the Alt, Fn and PrtScn keys will enable you to take a snapshot of one window on most laptops.</p><h4 id="Choosing-the-Region-of-the-Screen-You-Want-to-Capture"><a href="#Choosing-the-Region-of-the-Screen-You-Want-to-Capture" class="headerlink" title="Choosing the Region of the Screen You Want to Capture"></a>Choosing the Region of the Screen You Want to Capture</h4><p>Choosing which area of the screen you will include in your screenshot is only possible on the Windows 10’s Creator Update. After pressing the Windows, Shift and S keys, your screen will become grayed, and you can just left-click and drag the mouse cursor to designate the region of the screen you’d like to capture. Once you are ready, let go of the left mouse button and the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard. Open a document or a software and paste the screenshot you’ve created using the Ctrl+V keys.</p><h4 id="Bonus-How-to-Take-Screenshots-on-a-Windows-Tablet"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Take-Screenshots-on-a-Windows-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Take Screenshots on a Windows Tablet"></a>Bonus: How to Take Screenshots on a Windows Tablet</h4><p>All tablets offer a variety of ways to capture screenshots effortlessly. The quickest and easiest way to accomplish this is to use the hardware keys on your tablet, since other methods of taking screenshots on tablets may require you to invest more time and effort. Simply hold the Windows and Volume Down buttons and the device will take a screenshot that will be saved in the Screenshots folder, located in Pictures library. If you want to edit the screenshot you created on your tablet, you can use a photo editing app that enables you to crop the image or annotate the screenshot.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking screenshots on Windows 7,8 or 10 is a fun process that doesn’t require you to be a tech geek. Each method of creating screenshots we described in this article is equally effective, so anyone can choose the one they find the most convenient. Using Screen Sketch or Snipping Tool is the best option for PC owners who want to add annotations to their screenshots, while the PrtScrn button method is by far the quickest way to create a still image of a computer screen.</p><p>Leave a comment and let us know what is your favorite method of taking screenshots on PCs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-still-images-to-time-lapses-ipad-edition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  From Still Images to Time-Lapses  IPad Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leveraging-technology-tips-for-screenrec-utilization/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Leveraging Technology  Tips for ScreenRec Utilization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-advanced-hd-screen-capture-gadgets/"><u>[New] Advanced HD Screen Capture Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-detailed-tutorial-on-screen-capturing-in-online-meetings-google/"><u>[New] Detailed Tutorial on Screen Capturing in Online Meetings (Google)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-from-raw-to-stunning-the-role-of-luts-in-premiere-editing/"><u>[New] From Raw to Stunning  The Role of LUTs in Premiere Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-guide-to-excellent-voice-recorders-for-macs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Guide to Excellent Voice Recorders for Macs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-how-to-archive-your-nintendo-switch-gameplay/"><u>[New] How to Archive Your Nintendo Switch Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-camera-woes-ended-by-fix-obs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Camera Woes Ended by Fix -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ultimate-Low-Cost-Smart-Home-Devices-for-Gaming"><a href="#Ultimate-Low-Cost-Smart-Home-Devices-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate Low-Cost Smart Home Devices for Gaming"></a>Ultimate Low-Cost Smart Home Devices for Gaming</h2><p>Are you looking for the best gaming keyboard under 100$? Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest. Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper. The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive. They have a smaller pre-travel distance, which means they type more accurately. This is a good option if you are searching for the best gaming keyboard under 100$.</p><h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Five macro keys and each one is reprogrammed.</p><p>Separate media buttons.</p><p>Full-size keyboard.</p><h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>It is zone-lit rather than RGB.</p><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory.</p><p>Gaming isn’t as responsive.</p><h3 id="3-G413-Logitech"><a href="#3-G413-Logitech" class="headerlink" title="3.G413 Logitech"></a>3.G413 Logitech</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/g413-logitech.png"                      alt="g413-logitech"                ></p><p>A good keyboard with excellent gaming performance should appeal to the majority of entry-level gamers. We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on. ABS keycaps feel pleasant to touch and seem to be solid. Thus the keyboard provides excellent typing quality. It offers minimal latency for gamers. Therefore you won’t even notice any lag when playing. It features individually illuminated keys and illumination. However, it’s only offered in red.</p><h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Macros can be assigned to any of the function keys.</p><p>You can store your settings using the G HUB Logitech online sync feature if you wish to use them on a different computer.</p><p>The best inexpensive keyboard you can buy.</p><h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory</p><h3 id="4-Z15-EVGA"><a href="#4-Z15-EVGA" class="headerlink" title="4.Z15 EVGA"></a>4.Z15 EVGA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/z15-evga.png"                      alt="z15-evga"                ></p><p>The EVGA Z15 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with mechanical keys that we’ve tested. It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming. The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option.

It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest.

A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won’t be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware. So without wasting any time, let’s get to our main topic.</p><h2 id="THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES"><a href="#THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES" class="headerlink" title="THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES"></a>THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES</h2><h3 id="1-Dirt-Rally-2-0"><a href="#1-Dirt-Rally-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.Dirt Rally 2.0"></a>1.Dirt Rally 2.0</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dirt-rally-poster.jpg"                      alt="dirt-rally-poster"                ></p><p>If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list. There has probably never been anything better. Despite its unbalanced package, this car offers outstanding handling and a driving experience as gripping as anything else in this class. The best way to experience it is with a good wheel, but it’s unbeatable for communicating the pure thrill of a car and the challenge of a course.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>In terms of career mode, both rallycross and rally mode is available.</li><li>You can play Freeplay to compete for titles, create your own custom game, and run-time trials across all tracks.</li><li>In addition to joining the team, players can increase the ability of team members.</li><li>Overall it offers a great gameplay experience which is worth all the effort.</li></ul><h3 id="2-iRacing"><a href="#2-iRacing" class="headerlink" title="2.iRacing"></a>2.iRacing</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iracing-poster.jpg"                      alt="iracing-poster"                ></p><p>The eSports industry is well known for three things: its costs, time commitment, and toughness. In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available.

Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.</p><p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2"><a href="#5-rFactor-2" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling.

Players can find their dream cars in this game.</li><li>The sim racing experience that it offers is unmatchable to any other game.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione-3"><a href="#3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione"></a>3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione</h3><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assetto-corse-competizione-poster.jpg"                      alt="assetto-corse-competizione-poster"                ></p><p>The two experiences offered by Kunos Simulazioni are so different, yet both so good, that we’ve included them both. Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2-3"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid.

Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-rFactor-2-3"><a href="#5-rFactor-2-3" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a

The controller has an excellent battery life, very accurate analog sticks, and large buttons more substantial than those on the Switch joy cons. Especially if you’ve been using an Xbox 360 controller for a while and are ready to upgrade, it’s an excellent choice for your next PC controller.</p><p>Utilizing the Nintendo Switch Pro controller for most of your PC games is a breeze thanks to Steam’s controller configurator, which officially supports this controller.

To play games, not on Steam, you need to use this guide.</p><p>This article will tell you how to enable your Nintendo Switch Pro controller to work with Steam or Windows, either through a Bluetooth connection or a wired connection.

Vibration can be enabled or disabled by selecting a controller from the “Detected Controllers” list in the same setup screen as before. It is possible to calibrate the analog sticks by clicking the Calibrate button manually.

But what if you want to play a non-steam game using a switch pro controller? What will you do now? The switch pro controller hardware support will run out of luck in this scenario.</p><p>The main problem here now is how windows will detect your switch pro controller now if you want to play non-steam games. Luckily there are two simple solutions for this problem.</p><p><strong>Solution1:</strong> The first solution is to use an external Bluetooth adapter that is specifically designed for different types of gamepads. You will find plenty of them out there for switch pro controllers.</p><p><strong>Solution2:</strong> The second method is to use a software-based XInput Wrapper. There is plenty of software out there that provides this functionality. Just configure your switch pro controller with them, and you can easily use it on non-steam games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>This is how you can use your switch pro controller with your PC.

Most Mac users never have the need to change this setting, because they can always move the file to a folder where they want to store it. On the other hand, creating a lot of screenshots every day can make a chaos on your desktop. Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac"></a>Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac</h2><p>Changing the folder where you store your screenshots is not an irreversible process, which means that you can reset the destination where the files are saved to Desktop at any point. Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described. You just have to open the Terminal app and insert the following command into the prompt.</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screen capture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Username&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;</strong></p><p>Make sure that your username is properly written, and then press Enter to run the command.

In terms of features, Fraps has limited features as well as configuration settings. However, Fraps is easy to use and the limited controls are intuitive in nature.</p><p>Fraps offers great video quality even though there is a low frame rate and it does not require high computer configuration. On the other hand, OBS is highly customizable and there are advanced features available for video recording and even live streaming.

If you have low-budget, you should go for OBS Studio. In terms of features, OBS is far better than Fraps even though it is completely free to use. If you compare the user interface, Fraps is the clear winner. If you want a better alternative to OBS Studio and Fraps, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best screen recording software for Windows and Mac.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-effortless-webcam-recordings-on-hp-systems/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Effortless Webcam Recordings on HP Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-perfecting-your-recordings-using-nvidia-recorder/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Perfecting Your Recordings  Using NVIDIA Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-pros-approach-to-optimizing-zoom-settings/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Pro's Approach to Optimizing Zoom Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-balancing-speed-and-quality-choosing-between-lower-and-higher-fps/"><u>[New] Balancing Speed & Quality  Choosing Between Lower and Higher FPS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-datadeliverers-professional-view-for-2024/"><u>[New] DataDeliverers Professional View for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-youtube-visibility-with-featured-channels-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing YouTube Visibility with Featured Channels Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-techniques-for-saving-mobile-gameplay/"><u>[New] Essential Techniques for Saving Mobile Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-remedying-dark-images-while-streaming-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Remedying Dark Images While Streaming YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-obs-vs-shadowplay-which-to-choose/"><u>[New] OBS vs ShadowPlay - Which to Choose</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-premier-low-carbon-screen-recording-solutions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Premier Low-Carbon Screen Recording Solutions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-quick-tips-for-capturing-online-video-conversations/"><u>[New] Quick Tips for Capturing Online Video Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-combat-arcade-nintendo-switch-edition-max-156-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Combat Arcade  Nintendo Switch Edition (Max 156) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-guide-to-cool-and-captivating-disco-tags-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Guide to Cool and Captivating Disco Tags for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-visualize-your-workflow-top-free-screen-recorders-for-pc-and-mac-for-2024/"><u>[New] Visualize Your Workflow - Top Free Screen Recorders for PC & Mac for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-which-is-the-ultimate-screen-recorder-analyzing-bandicam-vs-camtasia/"><u>[New] Which Is the Ultimate Screen Recorder?

It works well with all major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It sets no limit on the duration of your films, which makes it great for hours-long recordings and video broadcasts. It can interact with video conferencing apps like Zoom smoothly, enabling you to enhance its usefulness and capabilities. All these capabilities of OBS Studio unarguably make it a helpful tool for video conferencing.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software Studio is mostly used by video broadcasters to live stream videos and events. However, it may also be a terrific video conferencing tool that lets you manage what’s on the screen. Today, many companies’ professionals utilize Zoom for organizing video meetings and exploring methods to improve their visual experience. If you are a Zoom user and seeking a means to make your video calls pixel-perfect, there is good news for you. The adaptability of OBS Studio answers your demands and enables you to link Zoom with OBS Studio.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Use Roblox Built-In Game Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom</h2><p>Zoom is one of the most popular video conferencing programs. The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu. Find and click on the plugin you have downloaded and follow the vizard to replicate OBS output as a virtual camera.</p><p>**<strong>Configure Zoom:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> In Zoom, begin a meeting, then pick a video source. The new option introduced by your OBS plugin will display.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image.

The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined.

Many mods are present that can act as add-ons for your Stardew Valley, providing controls over how your animals look like, fishing gets smoother, adding patches, and fixing game proportion.</p><p>This guide to best Stardew valley mods is thoroughly modern, which can customize this game using mods. We can decide how our game interior will look and how our farm life will get more leisure from these mods.</p><p>You can easily find the best Stardew Valley mods from the official Stardew Valley Mod forum. Where you can find the best Stardew Valley mods day by day and do not worry about the prospects of your computer, it is a benefit to use the best Stardew Valley mods That can play it on any low specs device.</p><p>A noticeable thing here is that Stardew Valley is still getting updates, and there is no official support for mods, so maybe you can get some mod-breaking issue that can make you reinstall the game. So the solution for this problem is to get a backup of your XNB file if you want to shift back to normal from any mod.</p><p>Now let’s see the seven best Stardew valley mods:</p><h3 id="1-Ali’s-Overgrown-Fairy-Buildings"><a href="#1-Ali’s-Overgrown-Fairy-Buildings" class="headerlink" title="1.Ali’s Overgrown Fairy Buildings"></a>1.Ali’s Overgrown Fairy Buildings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ali-overgrown-fairy-buildings.jpg"                      alt="ali-overgrown-fairy-buildings"                ></p><p>The pink and white texture of buildings is not every person’s taste, but the overgrown fairy buildings mod is so carefully designed that we have to add this mod to our list of best Stardew Valley mods. This mod is going to change your regular farm into pink and white textures. Vines and flowers will be added to buildings; everyone likes to customize its gaming environment, which is a very sweet personalization off your farm. And the thing I love most about Ali’s overgrown fairy buildings is that Smile Hutch is changed from a Palace to a small cottage with a garden full of flowers.</p><h3 id="2-Bathhouse-Hot-Spring"><a href="#2-Bathhouse-Hot-Spring" class="headerlink" title="2.Bathhouse Hot Spring"></a>2.Bathhouse Hot Spring</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bathhouse-hot-spring.png"                      alt="bathhouse-hot-spring"                ></p><p>At the north of Pelican Town, you can find Bathhouse Hot Spring.
