It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The <strong>ring-light camera</strong> is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With <strong>1080p full HD video at 30 FPS</strong>, on a <strong>2-megapixel base</strong> and <strong>built-in stereo microphones</strong>, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.</p><p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><p>For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO-2"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.</p><p>This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams-3"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams-3" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in Gaming Webcams"></a>What to Look for in Gaming Webcams</h2><ul><li>Video quality</li><li>Resolution</li><li>Microphone quality</li><li>Price</li><li>Low-light capabilities</li></ul><h2 id="Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have-3"><a href="#Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have-3" class="headerlink" title="Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have"></a>Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have</h2><ul><li>1080p resolution</li><li>60FPS</li><li>Stereo Audio</li><li>Ergonomic design</li><li>RealSense capabilities</li><li>Automatic light correction</li><li>Compatibility with both Windows and Mac</li></ul><p>So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:</p><h4 id="1-Ontop-HD-Webcam-3"><a href="#1-Ontop-HD-Webcam-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO-3"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo-3"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

The <strong>ring-light camera</strong> is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam-3"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list.

It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio.

Screen recorders are incorporated into several Android handsets. There are also hundreds of third-party screen recorder programs available for download, both free and premium. If you’re still looking for the finest <strong>android movie recorder</strong>, you may get the AZ screen recorder app right now. With its built-in technique, though, recording your iPhone’s screen is simple.</p><h3 id="For-Android"><a href="#For-Android" class="headerlink" title="For Android"></a>For Android</h3><p>AZ Screen Recorder is the most effective screen recording program I’ve discovered so far on Android, although there are many more others. It’s ad-free, doesn’t need root, has no restriction on recording time, and doesn’t apply watermarks. It’s not a terrible bargain at all. After you’ve downloaded it, go through the following steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Start the AZ Screen Recorder app by selecting it from your app drawer.</li><li>You’ll notice a four-button overlay emerge. The gear icon allows you to change the video recording parameters, including resolution, bit rate, and frame rate. Press Back to go to the home screen when you’re finished.</li><li>Start the app or browse to the screen you wish to capture and press “Record”.</li><li>AZ overlay’s AZ button has a red camera shutter icon. The video is about to start recording. Until you’re ready to stop recording, continue to use your phone usually.</li><li>Remove your finger from the notification shade when you’re done. You have the option of pausing or stopping the recording from the AZ notification.</li></ul><h3 id="For-iOS"><a href="#For-iOS" class="headerlink" title="For iOS"></a>For iOS</h3><p>Fortunately, if you understand how to activate it, taking a screenshot or recording a video on your iPhone’s screen is exactly as simple as before. Using your iPhone, here’s how to record your screen and locate the movie once it has been saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Then touch “Control Center” in the Settings app. Select “Customize Controls” from the drop-down menu. Look for the phrase “Screen Recording.” Tap the green + symbol next to it if it’s not already in the “Include” section. It should now appear in the “Include” column.</li><li>If you have an iPhone X or later, slide down from the top-right corner to activate the Control Center; swipe up if you have an iPhone 8 or older. The home button on an iPhone may be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the display.</li><li>Press and hold the “Record” button. This feature is activated by pressing the Record button for three seconds, after which the button becomes red and begins recording. The time will be red in the top left corner, indicating that you’re still recording.</li><li>Press the red time indication at the upper left of the screen, then tap “Stop” to stop recording. Alternatively, you may open the Control Center and press the record button once again.</li></ul><h2 id="Wrapping-UP"><a href="#Wrapping-UP" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping UP"></a>Wrapping UP</h2><p>Recording all of your favorite movies on your Mac or PC is now easy and enjoyable.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder-1"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings-1"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device-1"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session-1"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen-1"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

This feature allows you to record video via USB with the bundled Android Debug Bridge. To use this feature, your device should run on Android 4.4 or later.</p><p>Android Debug Bridge is a command-line utility that can control your Android Smartphone from a computer, copy files and add or remove apps. However, if you want to use ADB you’ll first need to go through the setup process, and even add it to the Windows System PATH.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB-1"><a href="#Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enabling the ADB"></a>Step 1: Enabling the ADB</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-screen-via-computer.jpg"                      alt=" Record Android Screen via Computer"                ></p><p>Locate the SDK’s installation folder on your PC, and click on the ADB option in the Platform Tools menu.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder-3"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings-3"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device-3"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session-3"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window.

This feature allows you to record video via USB with the bundled Android Debug Bridge. To use this feature, your device should run on Android 4.4 or later.</p><p>Android Debug Bridge is a command-line utility that can control your Android Smartphone from a computer, copy files and add or remove apps. However, if you want to use ADB you’ll first need to go through the setup process, and even add it to the Windows System PATH.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB-3"><a href="#Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enabling the ADB"></a>Step 1: Enabling the ADB</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-screen-via-computer.jpg"                      alt=" Record Android Screen via Computer"                ></p><p>Locate the SDK’s installation folder on your PC, and click on the ADB option in the Platform Tools menu.

Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-synchronized-camscreen-capture/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to Synchronized Cam/Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-pick-screen-capture-tools-for-apple-devices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Top Pick Screen Capture Tools for Apple Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/xploring-object-oriented-programming-for-complex-applications-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploring Object-Oriented Programming for Complex Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-peaceful-playtimes-best-idle-gaming-choices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Peaceful Playtimes Best Idle Gaming Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-your-web-comes-alive-explore-the-best-screen-recorder-software-for-browsers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Your Web Comes Alive Explore the Best Screen Recorder Software for Browsers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-bandicam-reconnaissance-a-comprehensive-review-of-its-features/"><u>[Updated] Bandicam Reconnaissance A Comprehensive Review of Its Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovate-iconoclastic-images-using-giphy/"><u>2024 Approved Innovate Iconoclastic Images Using Giphy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/6-fixes-to-unfortunately-whatsapp-has-stopped-error-popups-on-vivo-x-fold-2-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>6 Fixes to Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped Error Popups On Vivo X Fold 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/black-shark-5-pro-review-elevating-gaming-experience/"><u>Black Shark 5 Pro Review: Elevating Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/elevate-your-video-call-experience-with-the-best-live-recording-gadgets-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Video Call Experience with The Best Live Recording Gadgets for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/firefox-freeze-fixes-ultimate-troubleshooting-guide/"><u>Firefox Freeze Fixes: Ultimate Troubleshooting Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/free-theme-song-downloads-a-hassle-free-guide/"><u>Free Theme Song Downloads: A Hassle-Free Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/high-speed-top-8-screenshots-compilation-for-2024/"><u>High-Speed Top 8 Screenshots Compilation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/solving-the-issue-of-delayed-imessages-top-9-effective-solutions/"><u>Solving the Issue of Delayed iMessages: Top 9 Effective Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/toms-tech-insights-expert-reviews-and-comparisons/"><u>Tom's Tech Insights: Expert Reviews and Comparisons</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918719/19272" target="_top" id="1918719">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918719" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918719/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-1"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-1" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft-1"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft-1" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-3"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094428/7443" target="_top" id="2094428">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094428" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094428/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft-3"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

How to Record IPTV on Firestick</h2><p>The central concern is, your gadget should be fit for putting away long video documents for working without a hitch and well. Also, on the off chance that you wish to watch an IPTV channel simultaneously while recording, try to take IPTV Service with “2 associations” from your IPTV supplier.

All these capabilities of OBS Studio unarguably make it a helpful tool for video conferencing.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software Studio is mostly used by video broadcasters to live stream videos and events. However, it may also be a terrific video conferencing tool that lets you manage what’s on the screen. Today, many companies’ professionals utilize Zoom for organizing video meetings and exploring methods to improve their visual experience.

The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast.

How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this. Here’s what you need to do:</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Zoom and OBS. In OBS, under “Sources,” click the Plus button and choose “Display Capture.” This will work best if you have more than one monitor for your PC, but it will still operate if you just have one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-zomm-meetings.jpg"                      alt="record zoom meetings"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> You may use the “Window Capture” option and pick “Zoom.exe” as your source, although this might not always work. Name the capture anything you wish, then click “OK.” You may use the name of the monitor you’re using for Zoom to keep things simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-capture.jpg"                      alt="window capture"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> In OBS, click on “+” under “Sources” again, then pick “Audio Input Capture.” Rename the capture source if you wish to keep it distinct from the other source and prevent misunderstanding, then hit “OK.” Press “Start Recording.” Maximize Zoom to full-screen mode to make it the only visible application on display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-input-capture.jpg"                      alt="audio input capture"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>OBS enables recording into several video formats. But the major reason why you may want to learn how to record Zoom meetings using OBS is that the software may help firms gain a step ahead on their video production. OBS is the software of choice for many, if not most, of today’s internet broadcasters. This free program allows you to create “scenes,” utilizing your camera feed together with any other movies or photos you wish to incorporate. The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system.

Among live video streaming software, OBS Studio and Streamlabs Desktop clearly stand out. They are popular because they are completely free to use and they have all the necessary features a video streamer desire.</p><p>Not just live streaming on any online platform, they software applications also let you record your live streams, record your computer screen as well as webcam. Now the question arises whether to choose Streamlabs or OBS Studio. We will help you out in your decision making by providing a thorough comparison of OBS vs Streamlabs parameter by parameter.</p><h2 id="1-About-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-About-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. About OBS Studio"></a>1. About OBS Studio</h2><p>Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg"                      alt="obs pros and cons"                ></p><p>Performance:</p><p>OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.</p><p>However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.</p><p>Recording:</p><p>If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility.
