Users need to make manual adjustments for most features.</li><li>If you are looking for 4K quality; it may not serve your needs.</li><li>USB cord is too short and undetachable.</li></ul><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>There is no doubt to say that Razer Kiyo is a camera with one of the most <strong>thoughtful design</strong> in the market.

Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Capturing-Beats-Studio-Mac-Basics"><a href="#Capturing-Beats-Studio-Mac-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Capturing Beats: Studio Mac Basics"></a>Capturing Beats: Studio Mac Basics</h2><p>Sound Studio is one of the industry-leading audio recording software that has millions of downloads over different app stores and platforms. The application is specifically designed to match the high performance of MacBooks with the macOS support. The interface inside the application is handy with a bunch of tools for utilizing every aspect of sound recording. With Sound Studio you will feel almost like sitting in a record room with professional hardware.</p><p>The app even lets you digitalize any of the records from tapes as well as vinyl records and also lets you record any live performances that are going on with high-quality audio output. The equalizer in the application has dozens of features that will allow you to mix any of your recordings with background tracks, voice-overs, and many more digital effects. Here’s more about it:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio"></a>Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for powerful recording software that can give you industry-leading features, then Sound Studio is the best choice for you. It is specifically designed to provide an ultimate user experience with fewer complications and the highest quality output. And with the new updated version from Sound Studio, you will have even more functions on your lap. The following are some of the best features of the Sound Studio application:</p><p><strong>1. High-quality music output</strong></p><p>One of the basic requirements for any audio recorder is that the output quality for the recorded files must be crystal clear and shouldn’t be of low quality. And Sound Studio meets all these aspects in voice recording by providing its users HD quality output sounds with simple and easy steps.</p><p><strong>2. Multiple formats support</strong></p><p>The application is also enabled with multiple audio format supports which means that there are several formats in which you can create your record as well as export it. You can work with voice recordings from MP3 or M4A files and then you can save them in different formats such as AIDD and WAV.</p><p><strong>3. Fast and convenient editing</strong></p><p>The user interface along with the software integration of macOS gives Sound Studio a very fast yet convenient editing studio feature. In this section, you will be able to create your audio in several layers and save it with different digital effects such as reverb, delays, chorus, or even flange filters.</p><p><strong>4. Digital conversion</strong></p><p>The application also allows the users to visit their memory lane by helping them digitize the tapes as well as vinyl records from their PC itself. In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.</p><p><strong>5. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator</strong></p><p>For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.</p><p><strong>6. Live performance recording</strong></p><p>There are situations where we want to record the ongoing live performances from our systems and in such scenarios, Sound Studio can help you efficiently. With built-in live recording mode, you can record the live performances from voice actors almost instantly with the push of a few buttons on your system.</p><p><strong>7. Digital noise cancellation</strong></p><p>The application also cancels out the extra and unnecessary voices from the background after you record any voice in the Sound Studio. Thus, when you play it with enabling the digital noise cancellation feature, you will be able to listen to clear sound without any disruption from the outside world.</p><p><strong>8. Regular updates</strong></p><p>Updates are the most important things for any software since the developers provide a clean experience with each new update and try to remove the bugs and issues reported by users. Also, Sound Studio developers provide regular updates to all their users with just a one-time subscription.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Record Audio with Sound Studio?</h2><p>Sound Studio Mac is believed to be one of the most efficient and easy-to-use applications for audio recording. But since it has so many menus and options available in its studio audio interface, the features can seem to be overwhelming sometimes.</p><p>You can record audio and use Sound Studio by following these easy steps to avoid any complications:</p><p>First, visit the official website of Sound recording Studio and then download it to your macOS.

The player needs to follow the suspects without being seen by them to get to conclusions and solve the case. You are not bound to follow the storyline; you can take a side investigation case as well with the help of the notice board in his office. Will you be a successful detective and solve the cases to drive conclusions?</p><h4 id="7-The-Witcher-3-Wild-Hunt"><a href="#7-The-Witcher-3-Wild-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, there are quite a few downsides to traditional PPT files, PowerPoint produces because the contents of your presentations can be easily modified and used by someone else.</p><p>The 2010 and later versions of PowerPoint have addressed this issue by including the Save to Video option that enabled users to create video files which can be easily posted on social media, video sharing platforms or used in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion option featured in recent versions of PowerPoint has certain limitations that prevent you from choosing the video file format or including inserted media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.</p><p>That’s the reason why we’ve gathered 10 best PPT to video converters that make the process of producing a video from a PowerPoint presentation easy and fun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Choosing-PPT-to-Video-Converter-Software"><a href="#Tips-for-Choosing-PPT-to-Video-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software"></a>Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software</h2><p>Investing your money wisely is always a good idea because the most expensive solution is often not the best solution. The same is true for PPT to Video converter software, so before you go ahead and choose the program you will be using to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos here are a few tips that will help you make up your mind.</p><p>Checking the amount of video file formats supported by the software is the key step towards selecting the right converter because it will give you the versatility the PowerPoint’s built-in PPT to video converter lacks. What’s more, some of the programs for PPT to video file conversions don’t allow you to convert audio files or animations into videos, which can ruin the original presentation, so prior to buying a software make sure that it can turn multimedia files into videos as well.</p><p>Last, but certainly not the least, try to determine whether or not the software is cost-effective because there is absolutely no point in spending a lot of money on a software that has the same PPT to video file conversion capabilities as PowerPoint.</p><h2 id="10-Best-PPT-to-Video-Converters"><a href="#10-Best-PPT-to-Video-Converters" class="headerlink" title="10 Best PPT to Video Converters"></a>10 Best PPT to Video Converters</h2><h4 id="1-Wondershare-PPT2Video-Pro"><a href="#1-Wondershare-PPT2Video-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects.

Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Valheim-Seeds"><a href="#The-Best-Valheim-Seeds" class="headerlink" title="The Best Valheim Seeds"></a><strong>The Best Valheim Seeds</strong></h2><p>Since each seed will create a different world from the other worlds, you must check our list to find the best Valheim seeds for mining or speedrunners.</p><p> <em>“Note: The seed you select should be in direct line with your preferences in the game. ”</em></p><p>The Valheim players can use their world seeds to enter a world that has well-known challenges and layouts. Every world in this game gets a unique seed code for players to move around quickly. With the seed codes, players can keep notes of every saved world that they create.</p><p>Some of the best Valheim seeds include:</p><h3 id="1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K"><a href="#1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K" class="headerlink" title="1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K"></a>1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-1.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-1"                ></p><p>Since you may want your private Island far away from everything you know, this seed is the ideal one to plant. Aside from trying to get far away, the biomes in Valheim are filled with horrible creatures that can appear at your base whenever they like and destroy everything.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the seed you know for those who want a piece of land free from any monstrous atrocities. You will spawn it on a small island in the middle of the sea. And, the nearest boss here is Eikthyr. With such a seed, your inner Viking can be aligned with you to build a ship and sail further with plans on discovering newer lands.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt"><a href="#2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt" class="headerlink" title="2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt"></a>2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-2.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-2"                ></p><p>It is regarded as the ideal seed for the speedrunners in Valheim. Players in this world seed can spawn within a starter island with roughly four runes, close by traders and nearby bosses. The biomes here are in a distinct starter continent, plus the fifth boss can be likened to be as close as a raft that skips away. This seed is the perfect realm for the players that want to speedrun their game. While this world comes with four bosses, Haldor is on the Island as well. More so, players will find the fifth boss on a neighboring island.</p><h3 id="3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4"><a href="#3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4" class="headerlink" title="3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4"></a>3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-3.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Even if you think that you are the best in Valheim, you will need to learn how to build a ship to sail and discover materials and biomes. If you never knew, sailing does have a learning curve. First of all, you will need to get the necessary ingredients to make a vessel; then, the next thing is to learn the difference between the three boat types available and how to use the wind on your side.</p><p> <em>“Note: the boat types are Karve, longship, and raft. ”</em></p><p>While in the water, it is advisable to look out for horrifying serpents that dwell in the ocean. Though some players do not want to bother themselves with sailing, the ideal seed for you will be oV5BZHkqY4.</p><h3 id="4-Seed-maypoleplz"><a href="#4-Seed-maypoleplz" class="headerlink" title="4.Seed: maypoleplz"></a>4.Seed: maypoleplz</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-4.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-4"                ></p><p>In such a game that concentrates on surviving and crafting, all the help you need will be gotten. To help the amateur players, developers of Valheim added a unique yet rare structure to the game.</p><p>This structure is known as Maypole. It is furniture that is made available only to some Valheim world seeds. The players themselves cannot craft these Valheim seeds.</p><p>With the seed mapoleplz, you will be capable of spawning in a world that has Maypole lying towards the west. It simply means that if you construct a base around the structure, your character will be getting extra comfort when resting here.</p><h3 id="5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk"><a href="#5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk" class="headerlink" title="5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk"></a>5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-5.png"                      alt="valheim-seeds-5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Since Iron is among the best resources one can find in the Valheim game, it must be understood that it is hard to come by. There are so many things the players will need to do to access Iron.</p><p> <em>“Note: Iron is made available only in the Swamp biome. ”</em></p><p>Nevertheless, immediately you unlock the scrap Iron, you can quickly drop it in the smelter to process Iron. Then, you can begin creating weapons and your armor. More so, for those interested in Iron farming, seed t9n3WG6dFk is among the Valheim seeds that have a vast Swamp biome wholly filled with sunken crypts. You can easily explore these crypts and the muddy scrap piles that are prepared to be mined. Bear in mind that before you get to work, ensure that your wishbone is equipped.

When searching for the best Valheim seeds, this is the ideal seed you will need if you want to trade with Haldor. With this seed, you will be in a world where Haldor is very close to the point of spawning. You just need to head towards the east from the spawn point and follow the south coast. Then, you are to cross the water until you arrive at the black forest biome. When you find Haldor, you can use your coins to buy items like a yule hat, fishing rod, and anything else.</p><p>You can sell things to Haldor as well. These things could be rubies, silver necklaces, or even Amber. You can engage in selling things in exchange for coins.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>It is worthy to note that we have provided you with a full description of some of the best Valheim seeds.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ultimate-Budget-Headphones-to-Enhance-Game-Sounds"><a href="#Ultimate-Budget-Headphones-to-Enhance-Game-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate Budget Headphones to Enhance Game Sounds"></a>Ultimate Budget Headphones to Enhance Game Sounds</h2><p>Are you looking for the best gaming keyboard under 100$? Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest. Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper. The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive. They have a smaller pre-travel distance, which means they type more accurately. This is a good option if you are searching for the best gaming keyboard under 100$.</p><h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Five macro keys and each one is reprogrammed.</p><p>Separate media buttons.</p><p>Full-size keyboard.</p><h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>It is zone-lit rather than RGB.</p><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory.</p><p>Gaming isn’t as responsive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on. ABS keycaps feel pleasant to touch and seem to be solid. Thus the keyboard provides excellent typing quality. It offers minimal latency for gamers. Therefore you won’t even notice any lag when playing. It features individually illuminated keys and illumination. However, it’s only offered in red.</p><h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Macros can be assigned to any of the function keys.</p><p>You can store your settings using the G HUB Logitech online sync feature if you wish to use them on a different computer.</p><p>The best inexpensive keyboard you can buy.</p><h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Z15-EVGA"><a href="#4-Z15-EVGA" class="headerlink" title="4.Z15 EVGA"></a>4.Z15 EVGA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/z15-evga.png"                      alt="z15-evga"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The EVGA Z15 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with mechanical keys that we’ve tested. It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming. The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option. However, the wrist rest looks cheap.</p><p>Only linear MX Red Cherry keys are available, which take little effort to activate and provide no tactile feedback. Although the pre-travel length is somewhat greater than that of comparable gaming keyboards, the switches are still extremely sensitive and should not cause fatigue. You can reprogram or assign macros to any key, and it has some additional features like dedicated media buttons and a Windows lockout that stops you from inadvertently minimizing your game.</p><h5 id="Pros-4"><a href="#Pros-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>The quality and reliability are just adequate since the frame is composed of cheap-feeling plastic.</p><h5 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The illumination is limited to single blue color.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons.

Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros-15"><a href="#Pros-15" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons-15"><a href="#Cons-15" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12-3"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12-3" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper. The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive. They have a smaller pre-travel distance, which means they type more accurately.

We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on. ABS keycaps feel pleasant to touch and seem to be solid. Thus the keyboard provides excellent typing quality. It offers minimal latency for gamers. Therefore you won’t even notice any lag when playing. It features individually illuminated keys and illumination. However, it’s only offered in red.</p><h5 id="Pros-17"><a href="#Pros-17" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Macros can be assigned to any of the function keys.</p><p>You can store your settings using the G HUB Logitech online sync feature if you wish to use them on a different computer.</p><p>The best inexpensive keyboard you can buy.</p><h5 id="Cons-17"><a href="#Cons-17" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory</p><h3 id="4-Z15-EVGA-3"><a href="#4-Z15-EVGA-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Z15 EVGA"></a>4.Z15 EVGA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/z15-evga.png"                      alt="z15-evga"                ></p><p>The EVGA Z15 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with mechanical keys that we’ve tested. It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming. The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-18"><a href="#Pros-18" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-18"><a href="#Cons-18" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63-3"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option. However, the wrist rest looks cheap.</p><p>Only linear MX Red Cherry keys are available, which take little effort to activate and provide no tactile feedback. Although the pre-travel length is somewhat greater than that of comparable gaming keyboards, the switches are still extremely sensitive and should not cause fatigue. You can reprogram or assign macros to any key, and it has some additional features like dedicated media buttons and a Windows lockout that stops you from inadvertently minimizing your game.</p><h5

Due to the low frame rate, the captured long-duration video plays in a very short time. Suppose you want to capture the moving clouds for an hour. When you capture in timelapse mode, the hour-long event will be captured in a few minutes of video.</p><p>If you own an iPad, you can create stunning timelapse videos easily. All the modern iPad variants have the timelapse feature. You can create short timelapse videos of any event and put them on social media platforms. Besides, adding a timelapse video to a regular video enhances the content. We will illustrate how to record iPad time lapse in simple steps.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Record-Timelapse-Video-on-iPad"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Record-Timelapse-Video-on-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Record Timelapse Video on iPad"></a>Part 1. Steps to Record Timelapse Video on iPad</h2><p>You can find the timelapse video option on all modern iOS devices. The timelapse feature is available on all iPads. You can find the timelapse feature on iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad, and iPad Mini. You will need a tripod to fix your iPad to capture timelapse video. The iPad should stay still in its position during the entire timelapse capturing session. Here are the steps on how to time lapse on iPhone and iPad.</p><p>Step 1: On your iPad, tap on Camera app from the home screen.</p><p>Step 2: On the camera app, you will notice camera modes like Photo, Video, and Slow-Mo. Swipe right until Time-Lapse is selected as the camera mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-timelapse-on-ipad-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable timelapse ipad camera"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fix your iPad on the tripod and set the video frame perfectly. Tap on the Shutter button below Time-Lapse and the recording will start.</p><p>Step 4: When you want to stop recording the timelapse video, press the Shutter or Stop button again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-time-lapse-on-ipad.jpg"                      alt="select time lapse ipad"                ></p><p>Step 5: You can go to Photos app to check out the timelapse video you have captured.

Related FAQs of iPad Timelapse"></a>Part 2. Related FAQs of iPad Timelapse</h2><p><strong>How long can iPad record time-lapse?</strong></p><p>Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad. These important factors can limit the recording duration of your time-lapse video. The longer the duration of the time-lapse, the lower will be the frame rate.</p><p><strong>How do you time a video on iPad?</strong></p><p>You cannot set a fixed time duration for capturing a video on iPad. You have to manually start and stop recording a video on iPad. However, you can always trim the video duration as per your requirements. You can use iMovie app to trim the video duration and time your video accordingly.</p><p><strong>Can you turn a regular video into a timelapse?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can turn a regular video into a timelapse video easily on iPhone and iPad. You can use iMovie app that comes pre-installed. Otherwise, you can install it from App Store. Besides, you can use any timelapse app such as Lapse-It and SpeedPro to turn your regular video into a timelapse video.</p><p><strong>How long is a 1 hour time lapse on iPhone?</strong></p><p>When the recording duration is one hour in timelapse mode, iPhone frame capture rate is 1 frame per second. This means a 1-hour time lapse on iPhone will be 4 minutes. The calculation is that you have to divide the recording duration in seconds by one frame capture duration in seconds. In this case, you need to divide 3600 seconds by 4 seconds. This comes to 240 seconds which is 4 minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>There is no doubt that taking a timelapse video with iPhone is a cakewalk However, if you own an iPad, you can capture stunning timelapse videos as well.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Alternative"></a>4. Best Alternative</h2><p>If you are looking for a better alternative to SplitCam after not being satisfied with its features and functionalities, we recommend you opt for Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

How To Download and Use SplitCam?"></a>1. How To Download and Use SplitCam?</h2><p>SplitCam is available completely free of cost for Windows users. It is compatible with Windows 7 and Windows 10. Here are the steps you need to follow in order to download and record your screen with SplitCam.</p><p>Step 1: Visit “splitcamera.com” for SplitCam download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-visit-and-download.jpg"                      alt="splitcam visit and download"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install the application and launch SplitCam.</p><p>Step 3: Click on “+” icon to add a scene to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-add-a-scene-to-record.jpg"                      alt="splitcam add a scene to record"                ></p><p>Step 4: Thereafter, click on “+” icon under Media Layers to select the video source. If you want to record your screen, go to Share Display &gt; Share Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-share-screen.jpg"                      alt="splitcam share screen"                ></p><p>Step 5: Once you are ready, click on Record icon to start recording. The icon will turn red which means recording is going on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-icon-turn-red.jpg"                      alt="splitcam icon turn red"                ></p><p>Step 6: To stop recording, click on the same Record icon. You can press Ctrl and click on Record icon to go to the location where the recording is saved.</p><h2 id="2-Key-Features-of-SplitCam"><a href="#2-Key-Features-of-SplitCam" class="headerlink" title="2. Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.</p><p>Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

The introduction of a hybrid console is truly a success that offers an extraordinary graphical quality while transitioning within the home console. Although this unique adaptability needs the compromise over functionality and power compared with the handhelds and dedicated consoles that have been introduced before. The games are played on the home part that is dock and console itself, over which we put the console in the dock to get the output image over the TV screen.</p><p>Moreover, it doesn’t require the installation of the software over the hard drive. It also includes the Micro SD slot at the switch backside, which provides additional storage capacity. But the main question is <strong>how to record switch gameplay</strong>?</p><p>There are basically three ways for <strong>Nintendo switch video capture</strong> gameplay.</p><p>This article will be in two part:</p><hr><p>Part I: Capture Your Switch Video</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"></a><a href="#part3"><strong>3. Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button"><a href="#1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button"></a>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</h3><p>The controllers come up with the built-in capture button. However, this button only allows the screenshot of the video which is not ideal in any case. But it records the video for 30 seconds as well. If this time is enough to capture your gameplay then do the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hold the controller in your hand.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the capture button on the left side of controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-console-pic.png"                      alt="switch-game-console"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold down this capture button marked with the square</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait until the message regarding capture completion is received at the screen top</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Your last 30 seconds of gameplay will be saved in the ‘Albums.’ It will record the 30 seconds gameplay right before you press the button down, so there is no need to worry about hitting it in advance. It is a quite simple step and allows only posting the clips to social media or saving them in your phone album. It also provides video editing before posting it on social media. You will be able to see the Nintendo Switch video capture in the Albums.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-interface.png"                      alt="switch-interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function"><a href="#2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function" class="headerlink" title="2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function"></a>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</h3><p>If you wish to save some important moves of your game in your album, then here is the second way. Some games have the option of replay saving at their bottoms, <a class="link"   href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/27540/~/how-to-capture-and-edit-gameplay-video" >complete list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> including:</p><ul><li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></li><li><em>ARMS</em></li><li><em>Splatoon 2</em></li></ul><p>Let’s take Smach Bros as an example. To do the recording, follow the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As soon as you have finished the game, the screen of the final score appears. A button appears at the top right down corner of the screen ‘Do you want to save the game’. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-interface.png"                      alt="smash-bro-ending"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the ‘Y’ button and then click on ‘Save.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-saving.png"                      alt="smash-bros-saving"                ></p><p>Tips: Make sure that you don’t press buttons other than ‘Y’ if you want to save the gameplay. The game replay will be lost if you do so.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video will be saved in the replays where you can check it. Go to the ‘Menu’ and then ‘Replays’, and the saved video will appear here (however, there is one limitation of such replays saved, that is they will be deleted as soon as the game is updated so make sure that you save the game replays in your album).</p><p>To convert the replays in the video, a straightforward option is given in the menu ‘Convert to Video.’ Go to the replay that you would like to save. Look at the right down corner and click on the ‘Convert to Video’ option.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-quality1.jpg"                      alt="video-quality-interface"                ></p><p>Tips: Within the video conversion settings, you can include information about the display, music, sound effects, and video quality of the replay. Check all these settings and select them the way you want your gameplay to be. Video quality is the most important thing to consider.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your gameplay will be converted to the video. In the videos section of the game menu, you will find all the videos that you have saved. Now power off your Switch and remove the SD card from your Switch. Connect the SD card with PC, it will appear in the folders shown below.</p><p> <strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-folder1.jpg"                      alt="saving-folder"                ></strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 3\.
