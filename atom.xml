Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Due to the hybrid nature of Switch, it offers much greater flexibility while gaming on the go. Nintendo Switch is a noteworthy gaming console since it is portable, in contrast to Xbox and Sony.</p><p>You can play the Switch directly on the TV, or you can connect it to your smart TV for playing on the big screen. In comparison to other gaming consoles, Switch has a competitive edge because it is portable and dockable. Each month, a new Switch game is released, keeping you occupied with various gaming genres.</p><p>Below we have compiled a list of some best Nintendo Switch Fighting Games. Choose a game based on your preferences and enjoy it.</p><h3 id="1-Street-Fighter-30th-Anniversary-Collection"><a href="#1-Street-Fighter-30th-Anniversary-Collection" class="headerlink" title="1.Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection"></a>1.Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/street-fighter-30th-anniversary-collection-poster.jpg"                      alt="street-fighter-30th-anniversary-collection-poster"                ></p><p>There are many Street Fighters in this collection; apart from Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V, it contains nearly every core entry in the franchise.

Featuring over 80 playable characters, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the latest entry in the series and the largest crossover yet. It may have been polarizing to some Smash fans, causing them to stick with Melee, but Smash Ultimate has both a gargantuan amount of content and a finely tuned platform fighter gameplay that makes it appealing to both casual and competitive players alike.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• This is an excellent party game</p><p>• Kirby fans’ version of Super Smash Bros</p><p>• Easy to learn and play</p><p>• Simple yet attractive gameplay</p><h3 id="3-Dragonball-FighterZ"><a href="#3-Dragonball-FighterZ" class="headerlink" title="3.Dragonball FighterZ"></a>3.Dragonball FighterZ</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dragonball-fighterz-poster.jpg"                      alt="dragonball-fighterz-poster"                ></p><p>As a result of the anime show’s popularity, Nintendo has known that new fans might try out fighting games for the first time as a result. While this Dragon Ball title might be a good introduction to the genre, veterans can also enjoy it. As in the comics and on-screen side of this universe, this title’s visual style perfectly fits the fans’ expectations. This game has recognizable moves, an extensive roster of warriors, and a pace that matches the speed these lethal soldiers should possess in battle.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Bringing Dragon Ball Z mayhem to life</p><p>• The visuals are stunning</p><p>• It’s fast and fun to play tag team</p><p>• Overall a great game to enjoy</p><h3 id="4-King-Of-Fighters-‘98"><a href="#4-King-Of-Fighters-‘98" class="headerlink" title="4.King Of Fighters ‘98"></a>4.King Of Fighters ‘98</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/king-of-fighters-98-poster.jpg"                      alt="king-of-fighters-98-poster"                ></p><p>King of Fighters is a fighting game franchise developed by a legendary game developer, SNK, with more than fifteen entries spanning nearly thirty years. Nearly every King of Fighters entry is currently available as a footsies-focused fighter that lets players create teams of characters. A notable exception is King of Fighters ‘98, which many have praised as the best entry in the series because it is incredibly polished and refined.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• A lot of versatile characters available to choose from</p><p>• Best action and fighting environment</p><p>• Despite being released more than two decades ago, the game still presents the same level of excitement and thrill</p><h3 id="5-Mortal-Kombat-11"><a href="#5-Mortal-Kombat-11" class="headerlink" title="5.Mortal Kombat 11"></a>5.Mortal Kombat 11</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mortal-kombat-11-poster.jpg"                      alt="mortal-kombat-11-poster"                ></p><p>In recent years, the Mortal Kombat series has grown in stature, and with HBO’s movie reboot coming soon, Mortal Kombat 11 on Nintendo Switch might be a good time to revisit it. The game uses the Switch platform well, even though it is not exclusive to the console.</p><p>The narrative in this game, along with its diverse roster and some of its surprises, has been praised. Even those with the Switch have access to this incredible game. This game may be the measuring stick for every other game in its genre.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The game presents the best cinematics</p><p>• On Switch, you can play this game at 60 fps</p><p>• The decent character rooster makes it even more interesting</p><p>• It is fun and enjoyable to play the game with each character’s unique abilities</p><h3 id="6-Power-Rangers-Battle-For-The-Grid"><a href="#6-Power-Rangers-Battle-For-The-Grid" class="headerlink" title="6.Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid"></a>6.Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/power-rangers-poster.png"                      alt="power-rangers-poster"                ></p><p>Bringing the two Japanese icons Nintendo &amp; Power Rangers, together is a feat to be celebrated. Fans are praising the game’s range of heroes from the beloved franchise, with its fast-paced gameplay working well on handheld devices.</p><p>Even though the game uses a tag-team mechanic that few others use, its gameplay is just as captivating as the show, despite the occasional shaky sound design. In terms of the use of complicated maneuvers, there are both simple and complex aspects to learn, but fans of the genre and brand should be interested in this game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• One of the best combat games that you might be missing out</p><p>• The game offers dynamic graphics</p><p>• Pretty simple controls with easy to learn functionality</p><h3 id="7-Streets-Of-Rage-4"><a href="#7-Streets-Of-Rage-4" class="headerlink" title="7.Streets Of Rage 4"></a>7.Streets Of Rage 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streets-of-rage-4-poster.png"                      alt="streets-of-rage-4-poster"                ></p><p>Although the game is available on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation as well, the Switch manages to give players a more immersive experience than those platforms. In this new generation of games, a franchise more than two decades old is brought back to its roots with updated graphics.</p><p>Although the mechanics are similar in a way, this is more like a return to a side-scrolling era, while many other titles utilize an arena matchup style of gameplay. Whether it’s the intense gameplay itself or the energetic campaign, players will continue to come back to the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Better gameplay experience as compared to other consoles</p><p>• Intense gameplay</p><p>• One of the best fighting games to play on Switch</p><h3 id="8-Naruto-Shippuden-Ultimate-Ninja-Storm-Trilogy"><a href="#8-Naruto-Shippuden-Ultimate-Ninja-Storm-Trilogy" class="headerlink" title="8.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Trilogy"></a>8.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Trilogy</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-poster.jpg"                      alt="naruto-shippuden-ultimate-poster"                ></p><p>The fan response to Naruto titles has been varied, and yet this new three-pack delivers all three games to the Nintendo Switch with updated graphics and all of the downloadable content. In the end, you’ll have a title that satisfies every fan of the franchise.</p><p>More so, the 3D style of gameplay develops in the series, which is quite refreshing in comparison to some of the 2D scroller games. A gripping story and a few unique combos make this a great game for those players who enjoy ongoing campaigns.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Naruto Lovers will definitely enjoy this game</p><p>• Best gameplay</p><p>• Extra-Ordinary graphics make it worth playing</p><h3 id="9-Kirby-Fighters-2"><a href="#9-Kirby-Fighters-2" class="headerlink" title="9.Kirby Fighters 2"></a>9.Kirby Fighters 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kirby-fighters-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="kirby-fighters-2-poster"                ></p><p>While Kirby is likely to appear in Super Smash Bros, why is one enough when there are nearly two dozen?

This is an incredibly wacky game in every imaginable sense, with its colorful visuals giving a hint of the fun to be had.</p><p>Despite its chaos, it’s relatively easy to participate. Fighting arenas in these games are characterized by their enormous boxing gloves and stretching arms, with players facing off in a wide variety of locations, yet somewhat uninspired. As for the balance, other games in the genre suffer from the same frustrations as this one does.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Convenient controls and simple concept</p><p>• It plays easily with little effort</p><p>• Younger gamers will enjoy this game because it isn’t violent</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>In this article, we shared a list of some best Nintendo switch fighting games with you.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Fraps-Your-Go-To-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Fraps-Your-Go-To-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Fraps: Your Go-To Screen Recorder?"></a>Fraps: Your Go-To Screen Recorder?</h2><p>If you like to record video games, Fraps can help you take your YouTube channel to new heights. Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Record Screen with Fraps"></a>2. How to Record Screen with Fraps</h2><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> When you first launch Fraps, you’ll see that there isn’t much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3. Pros and Cons"></a>3. Pros and Cons</h2><p>The number of frames per second (FPS) may be seen in the corner of the screen by users. After a picture is acquired, the platform automatically names and timestamps it. It also includes features for video files such as movie cursor hiding, stereoscopic 3D, and RGB capturing.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Fraps enable you to record high-quality DirectX or OpenGL games.</li><li>It enables you to see the number of frames per second (FPS) that you are receiving.</li><li>You may also snap a screenshot at any time interval using Fraps.</li><li>It enables you to record high-quality DirectX and OpenGL games.</li><li>It’s free to use for frame rate display and benchmarking, and it’s free to use for video capture with certain restrictions (30-second time limit).</li><li>It enables you to simultaneously record your games with computer sound and your voice.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Your computer screen, webcam, or face cam cannot be recorded.</li><li>The Microsoft Store does not enable you to record DirectX 12 or Windows games.</li><li>It is not possible to record the computer screen or webcam.</li><li>You can’t post a captured video to YouTube or Vimeo using it.</li><li>The Mac version of Fraps Screen Recorder is currently unavailable.</li></ul><h2 id="4-Best-Fraps-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Fraps-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Fraps Alternative"></a>4. Best Fraps Alternative</h2><p>One of its primary issues may have an impact on the game’s internal performance. When using Frap Screen Recorder to record, the quality of the recording degrades by roughly 13%. It may create lag and sluggish progress on their computer, and the reason for this may be due to the game’s high settings; thus, the game should be adjusted to the lowest level and played at a lower resolution. Fraps Screen Recorder does not fulfill your demands, which is one of the reasons you are seeking a solution. Yes, I see why. Fraps Screen Recorder is a unique screen recording application. Filmora Screen Recorder is another choice for Fraps Screen Recorder.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Fraps-Screen-Recorder-Review"><a href="#Fraps-Screen-Recorder-Review" class="headerlink" title="Fraps Screen Recorder Review"></a>Fraps Screen Recorder Review</h2><p>If you like to record video games, Fraps can help you take your YouTube channel to new heights. Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings.

There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

Downscale Your Output Resolution"></a>Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution</h2><p>The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate"></a>Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate</h2><p>The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.</p><p>Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting. Restart your computer and resume your OBS operation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-apply-and-ok-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on apply and ok button"                ></p><h2 id="Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset"><a href="#Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Change Encoder Preset"></a>Way 3. Change Encoder Preset</h2><p>By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).</p><p>Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.</p><p>Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button. Restart your computer and perform your action on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-encoder-preset.jpg"                      alt="obs change encoder preset"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding"><a href="#Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding"></a>Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding</h2><p>You can try out different hardware encoders available such as Quicksync, AMF, or NVENC. The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.</p><p>Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.</p><p>Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings. Restart your computer and perform your operation on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-restart-your-computer-and-perform-your-operation.jpg"                      alt="obs restart your computer and perform your operation"                ></p><h2 id="Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings"><a href="#Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings"></a>Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings</h2><p>If you are still facing OBS high encoding problem, you need to change some advanced settings in order to fix this encoder overloaded issue. You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.</p><p>Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.</p><p>Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.</p><p>Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes. Restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-open-and-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs open and go to settings"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative"><a href="#Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Use OBS Alternative"></a>Way 6. Use OBS Alternative</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned ways can solve the constant encoding overloaded warning you are receiving while using OBS Studio for recording or streaming, you have to opt for an alternative. Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to OBS for recording screen and webcam. Filmora does not affect the CPU performance as significantly as OBS Studio does.

However, there are certain OBS issues that are often reported on different forums. OBS Studio not recording full screen is a common complaint. There are many who have reported that OBS is capturing Windowed screen but as soon as they are switching to Full screen recording, OBS fails miserably and captures only a black screen instead. There could be various reasons behind OBS full screen not working.</p><p>First of all, OBS Studio files could have got corrupted somehow. Sometimes, OBS Studio is heavily using CPU resources in capturing full screen, and hence, due to very fast access, CPU has limited the access of usage. There are could be a compatibility issue with OBS Studio and your Windows version. Sometimes, any third-party screen recording software could intervene in OBS operation. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to fix OBS does not recording full screen issue.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS"><a href="#Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS"></a>Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS</h2><p>By default, OBS CPU usage present is set to very fast. This means the encoder is running very fast which leads to less CPU time usage. The higher the present, the less is the CPU usage. Unless you have a high-end computer, this default setting can lead to rendering and encoding issues. OBS uses more CPU resources when you are recording full screen. CPU tends to limit its allocation for OBS when OBS starts using CPU resources at a very fast speed. This leads to OBS not full screen recording issue. You should change the setting by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and go to Controls tab.</p><p>Step 2: Click on Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-settings-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on settings button"                ></p><p>Step 3: Go to Output tab and change Output Mode from Simple to Advanced.</p><p>Step 4: Change CPU Usage Present from Veryfast to Ultrafast so that OBS uses less CPU resources for the encoding process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-cpu-usage.jpg"                      alt="obs change cpu usage"                ></p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording"><a href="#Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording"></a>Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording</h2><p>There are certain gaming features available in Windows 10 that cause rendering issue for OBS studio. If game mode is on, all the GPU resources are used in the active game and hence, OBS suffers in performance. Similarly, if Game Bar recording is on, it interferes with OBS Studio full screen recording and leads to OBS studio not recording full screen game. You need to turn off Game Bar recording by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Settings app.</p><p>Step 2: From Setting, open Gaming option.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Xbox Game Bar tab on the left side.</p><p>4: Turn it off so that it does not record your gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-settings-xbox-game-bar.jpg"                      alt="windows settings xbox game bar"                ></p><h2 id="Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode"><a href="#Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode"></a>Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode</h2><p>One of the common reasons why OBS does not recording full screen is due to compatibility issue with the operating system. That is why there is an option available in Windows to run any application in compatible mode with lower Windows version. You can do the same for OBS Studio and there are many users who have reported the issue of full screen recording getting solved when they changed the compatibility mode to Windows 8. Here are the steps you have to take.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and open Task Manager.</p><p>Step 3: On Task manager, find OBS Studio under Apps. Right-click on it and select Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-task-manager-properties.jpg"                      alt="windows task manager properties"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Properties, copy the file location. Open File Explorer and go to the copied location by pasting on Address Bar.</p><p>Step 5: Find OBS Studio Application file and right-click on it and select Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/found-obs-studio-application-file.jpg"                      alt="found obs studio application file"                ></p><p>Step 6: Go to Compatibility tab and turn on “Run This Program In Compatibility Mode For”. Select Windows 8 from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs64-properties-run.jpg"                      alt="obs64 properties run"                ></p><p>Step 7: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p>Relaunch OBS Studio and check if the problem is solved.</p><h2 id="Way-4-Turn-Your-Gameplay-to-Windowed-Mode"><a href="#Way-4-Turn-Your-Gameplay-to-Windowed-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Turn Your Gameplay to Windowed Mode"></a>Way 4. Turn Your Gameplay to Windowed Mode</h2><p>When OBS Studio not recording full screen game, you have to move to Windowed Mode momentarily to ensure OBS Studio is actually capturing the gameplay or not. After capturing your gameplay in Windowed mode, you can switch to Full Screen Mode and check if the problem is solved. This helps as the default settings get reset and any issue with the settings causing the problem gets resolved. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Move your game from full screen mode to windowed mode. You need to check the Settings of your game and bring out the resolution and screen dimensions so that it moves to Windowed Mode from full screen settings.</p><p>Step 2: Open OBS Studio and from Sources, click on “+” icon and select Display Capture.</p><p>Step 3: Right-click on Display Capture and click on Windowed Projector option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-your-gameplay-to-windows-mode.jpg"                      alt="turn your gameplay to windows mode"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Start Recording and move to your Windowed game screen. After recording for a few seconds, click on Stop Recording. Check if the recording has been successful.</p><p>Step 5: Thereafter, you can move your game to full screen mode. On OBS, you can then select Fullscreen Projector and select your monitor. Start recording again and see if OBS can capture the full screen now.</p><h2 id="Way-5-Re-install-OBS"><a href="#Way-5-Re-install-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Re-install OBS"></a>Way 5. Re-install OBS</h2><p>Sometimes, the problem is with OBS Studio itself and not an external issue. There are times when OBS Studio may have crashed and in the process, certain important files of OBS Studio may have got corrupted. If the above solutions are not working to fix OBS not recording full screen issue, you have to uninstall and reinstall OBS Studio. In the process, you will be able to install the latest version of OBS Studio where minor glitches are fixed. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features option.</p><p>Step 2: From the list of installed applications, find OBS Studio and click on Uninstall&#x2F;Change button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/re-install-obs-uninstall.jpg"                      alt="re install obs uninstall"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once OBS Studio is successfully uninstalled, open your web browser and visit “obsproject.com”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p>Step 4: Download and install OBS Studio as per your operating system. Give all the necessary permissions during installation.</p><p>Step 5: Launch the OBS Studio after installation and check if you can record in full screen mode.</p><h2 id="Way-6-Use-OBS-alternative"><a href="#Way-6-Use-OBS-alternative" class="headerlink" title="Way 6.
