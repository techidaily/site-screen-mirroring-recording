Screen recordings are not immune to background noises and for that reason, anyone using screen capturing software should do everything in their power to ensure that the environment in which they are recording a video is as quiet as it possibly can be.</p><p>Creating perfect conditions for audio recording is often hard, due to unforeseen events that can happen while the screen recording session is in progress. Most modern screen recording and video editing computer programs provide features that enable their users to reduce noise levels in their videos significantly. In this article, we are going to provide our readers with a few different methods of reducing or removing noise from their videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#reducenoisefree">Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free</a></li><li><a href="#reducenoisefilmorascrn">A better way to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording with One-click</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Audio-Noise-in-a-Video-Recording-For-Free-with-Audacity"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Audio-Noise-in-a-Video-Recording-For-Free-with-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free with Audacity"></a>Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free with Audacity</h2><p>It can hardly be stressed enough how important it is to be prepared for the post-production process, because during the time you spend in the editing room you’ll realize that if you are missing something which may seem trivial, like a room tone recording can prove to be crucial for the success of your video making endeavor.</p><p>A <strong>room tone</strong> is an audio recording of the atmospheric sounds of the room in which you recorded the video. It is frequently used as a baseline for the soundtrack of an entire video since it can help the software remove the unwanted noises from the video’s original audio file. Room tone recordings become even more important if you already know that you’ll have to deal with background noises during the video editing process.</p><p>Besides the room tone recording, you will also need some audio editing software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>if you want to remove or at least reduce the levels of audio noise. However, you can only use this software to work with audio files.</p><p>In order to start removing background noises from an audio file, you first need to import the file into Audacity and place it on the software’s timeline. Afterward, you should place the room tone recording to the timeline as well, and then select the silent part of the recording. Once you’ve selected the portion of the room tone recording you’d like to use, find the <strong>Effects</strong> menu, and select the <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/noise-reduction-with-audacity.jpg"                      alt="Noise Reductioin"                ></p><p>In the next step, you should click on the <strong>Get Noise Profile</strong> feature, and proceed to deselect the room tone audio file on the timeline.

Removing background audio noises after recording with a software program like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a better option since it enables you to edit audio and video files in the same project.</p><p>Import the video file into Filmora video editor and place the file on the timeline. Select the audio file and head over to the Audio menu on the left side of the screen. Make sure that the Enable checkbox, in the Denoise menu is marked and then proceed to select Weak, Mid or Strong value. You can play the video and hear if the background noises have been removed. If the audio track has too much noise, you can use the Mute option or you can detach the audio file from the video file and delete it. That’s how easy it is to remove background noises with Wondershare Filmora.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Regardless of the type of video you are creating, having crystal clear audio is equally important as producing sharp, high-resolution videos.

noises you might have accidentally captured during a screen recording session.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top"

You can use iMovie app to trim the video duration and time your video accordingly.</p><p><strong>Can you turn a regular video into a timelapse?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can turn a regular video into a timelapse video easily on iPhone and iPad. You can use iMovie app that comes pre-installed. Otherwise, you can install it from App Store. Besides, you can use any timelapse app such as Lapse-It and SpeedPro to turn your regular video into a timelapse video.</p><p><strong>How long is a 1 hour time lapse on iPhone?</strong></p><p>When the recording duration is one hour in timelapse mode, iPhone frame capture rate is 1 frame per second. This means a 1-hour time lapse on iPhone will be 4 minutes. The calculation is that you have to divide the recording duration in seconds by one frame capture duration in seconds. In this case, you need to divide 3600 seconds by 4 seconds. This comes to 240 seconds which is 4 minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->## The Bottom Line<p>There is no doubt that taking a timelapse video with iPhone is a cakewalk However, if you own an iPad, you can capture stunning timelapse videos as well. All you need to do is place the iPad on a firm tripod. Make sure it does not get disturbed during the timelapse capturing session. You can capture timelapse video on your iPad directly from the Camera app. If you want to customize the timelapse settings, you can install a timelapse app on your iPad.</p><p>A timelapse video is where you record an event for a long duration at a regular interval. Due to the low frame rate, the captured long-duration video plays in a very short time. Suppose you want to capture the moving clouds for an hour. When you capture in timelapse mode, the hour-long event will be captured in a few minutes of video.</p><p>If you own an iPad, you can create stunning timelapse videos easily. All the modern iPad variants have the timelapse feature. You can create short timelapse videos of any event and put them on social media platforms. Besides, adding a timelapse video to a regular video enhances the content. We will illustrate how to record iPad time lapse in simple steps.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-insert-youtube-links-for-an-engaging-ppt-experience/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Insert YouTube Links for an Engaging PPT Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-paired-monitors-preservation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Paired Monitors Preservation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-perfect-pc-video-grabbers-a-comprehensible-selection/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Perfect PC Video Grabbers  A Comprehensible Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-zero-dollar-mac-capture-mastery/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Zero-Dollar Mac Capture Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-best-practices-in-digital-media-capturing-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Practices in Digital Media Capturing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-crucial-techniques-for-documenting-lol-wars-for-2024/"><u>[New] Crucial Techniques for Documenting LOL Wars for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-expert-gaming-techniques-mastering-switch-pro-controller-on-steam/"><u>[New] Expert Gaming Techniques  Mastering Switch Pro Controller on Steam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-media-making-filmoras-edge-over-democreator/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Media Making  Filmora's Edge Over Democreator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-screenmasters-battleground/"><u>[New] In 2024, ScreenMasters Battleground</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-maximum-definition-boost-expert-video-upscaler/"><u>[New] Maximum Definition Boost  Expert Video Upscaler</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-live-transmission-via-obs-to-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Live Transmission via OBS to Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-prevent-freezing-of-streamed-videos-in-chrome/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Prevent Freezing of Streamed Videos in Chrome</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-simplifying-tasks-with-ez-grabber-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Simplifying Tasks with EZ Grabber Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-top-picks-for-instant-recorder-performance-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top Picks for Instant Recorder Performance for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-your-ultimate-ps4-screen-recorder-inside-the-obs-studio-guide/"><u>[Updated] Your Ultimate PS4 Screen Recorder  Inside the OBS Studio Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capturing-every-move-in-games-with-fbx/"><u>2024 Approved  Capturing Every Move in Games with FBX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mycam-reviewed-how-it-meets-expectations-for-home-recorders/"><u>2024 Approved  MyCam Reviewed  How It Meets Expectations for Home Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-3-essential-voice-logging-tactics-for-ipad/"><u>2024 Approved  The 3 Essential Voice Logging Tactics for iPad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-art-of-professional-gopro-filming/"><u>2024 Approved  The Art of Professional GoPro Filming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/does-xiaomi-civi-3-have-find-my-friends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Xiaomi Civi 3 Have Find My Friends? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/evolutionary-tools-redefining-the-art-of-game-capture-beyond-fbx-for-2024/"><u>Evolutionary Tools Redefining the Art of Game Capture Beyond FBX for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/exceptional-hd-video-documentation-gear-for-2024/"><u>Exceptional HD Video Documentation Gear for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/high-gear-comparison-gopros-best-match-ghost-s-drift/"><u>High Gear Comparison  GoPro's Best Match?

It is true that these games are not very graphically intense and can’t compete for the AAA titles, but it won’t be fair to compare them with those heavy and graphics-intensive games. Played repeatedly, these games continue to keep players interested even after they are released for years. But who cares that much if you’re just looking for some good rogue game to play.</p><h2 id="What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game"><a href="#What-is-a-roguelike-game-What-is-a-roguelite-game" class="headerlink" title="What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?"></a>What is a roguelike game? What is a roguelite game?</h2><p>Gamers have been debating whether roguelikes are different from roguelites for years. If you study them in general, you will find that both roguelikes and roguelites are the RPGs subgenres. In general, roguelikes and roguelites place more emphasis on death than other kinds of video games do.</p><p>You might have a question in your mind that what is a <strong>roguelike game</strong>? It is a convoluted category of games, but it had a clear beginning. It all started with an early dungeon crawling game, “Rogue” in 1980. At that time, computers were very limited in their speed and memory capabilities.</p><p>You have to give credit to the computer programmers because instead of taking the low memory capacity of computers as a limitation at that time, they developed a game and introduced the concept of “procedural generation to save the memory space.” If you have ever played a game that has randomly generated level systems and each time gives you a unique experience, then you have already tried a roguelike game or a roguelite game.</p><p>In roguelikes, players’ progress is usually lost if they die, while in roguelites, rewards or progression are usually saved between runs. This is the main difference between roguelikes and roguelites. Although there are many other differences, let’s focus on discussing the best roguelike games and roguelite games present today.</p><p><strong>Want a more detailed explanation?

Their first title was FTL: <strong><em>Faster Than Light</em></strong> in 2012. FTL could have taken this spot, but Into the Breach’s design and hidden depth make it stand out among the competition. It’s a game of turn-based tactics where your team is faced with an army of monsters known as the Vek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/into-the-breach.png"                      alt="into-the-breach"                ></p><p>There’s only one way to hold off their attack, and that is to enlist some giant mechs. But you’ll have to agonize over every decision if you intend to keep your team intact. The more you progress through the game’s islands, the more advanced equipment you’ll find, so you can turn the tide of war and save humankind.</p><p>This is one of the most accessible strategy games out there, and its straightforward combat won’t offend novices, but you should expect something more challenging, though rewarding, from Into the Breach.</p><h2 id="6-Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#6-Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="6.

You have no choice but to battle your way up the tower, which is also home to many monsters. This is an ideal entry point to the single-player card battler genre as it does away with the pre-battle faff. It’s also a surprising roguelike that blends options from your adventures to create an instantaneous action experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><p>The game, released in 2017, has gained massive audience recognition thanks to its 10&#x2F;10 Steam rating and over 60,00 reviews despite its simplistic art and simplistic interface.

This game was released in 2015, featuring catchy soundtracks and groovy boss fights — a distinct title for gamers looking for a new challenge. While you’re running out of time before your next move, Crypt of the Necrodancer will have you tapping your foot and dripping with sweat as you keep ongoing.</p><p>This game deviates from roguelike conventions, forcing players to arrive at snappy judgments quickly. While quick decision-making and foresight are required in the genre, the escalating rhythm forces players to maintain a higher tempo to maintain a strong combo, and all you know is, you can’t lose the combo. If you haven’t tried this game yet, then it’s worth your time and money.</p><h2 id="8-Dead-Cells"><a href="#8-Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="8.

You need to buy additional characters, though. They differ in cost, and some are $1.99 while others can be upwards of $2.99. It’s not expensive for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily ideal.</p><p>The Otherworld Legends game is incredibly entertaining to play with beautiful graphics, and enjoyable setting, and a cast of interesting characters.

Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames"><a href="#Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?"></a><strong>Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?</strong></h2><p>OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.</p><ul><li>Your computer has an unstable internet connection.</li><li>Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.</li><li>Your video output resolution is very high.</li><li>Your video bitrate is very high.</li><li>Your internet upload speed is rather low.</li><li>antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.mirillis.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4704640&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/547a5a56d43f6d40f9a6a2f76501d013/products/1_mirillis_action_boxshot_store_1x.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>    Home Use license is dedicated for personal, non-commercial use only.<br>    If Action! is used for commercial gain or to further any commercial purpose,<br>    a Commercial Use license is required.

Games that allow you to progress quite effectively even without being active for an extended period are the best mobile idle games.</p><p>There is no limit to how many idle games you can play, and you can finish all your daily tasks in only minutes. It does not matter if you like to play Android RPGs, tycoon games, or whatnot. There are plenty of idle games out there for you to choose from.</p><p>In general, idle games fall into two categories: the true idle game, where you can leave your game running for hours but still gain progress (resources, levels, currency, etc. ), or the pseudo-idle game that claims to be idle. The latter category consists of idle clickers and the like, where progress is more likely to be made by tapping than simply being idle.</p><p>You need only know that idle games (if you find the right ones) can be delightful if you’re unfamiliar with either of them. Please let me give you a hand if you’re still in search!

Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.</p><p>**<strong>Multiple Recording Modes:</strong></p><p>With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.</p><p>**<strong>All-in-One:</strong></p><p>The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.</p><p>**<strong>Protected:</strong></p><p>With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.</p><p>**<strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer. Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.</p><p>**<strong>No Storage:</strong></p><p>Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage. However, in the case of RecordCast, you save a considerable amount of storage by not installing it on your PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729507&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/TIU/Nero_TuneItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                >&#x2F;a&gt;</p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use RecordCast"></a>Part 2: How to Use RecordCast</h2><p>With the three RecordCast, you can record your screen or webcam, download it and edit it the way you like to online.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-2"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>The features of the application seem to be great for capturing any screen activities. Besides, there are various advanced options available such as record specific areas or record without cursor. These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording. Here are the steps to download –</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Microsoft Store.</p><p>Step 2: Search for “screen recorder pro for win10”.</p><p>Step 3: Select the first app from the search result page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-recorder-pro-store.jpg"                      alt="search recorder from store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Get button to download and install Screen Recorder Pro APK automatically.</p><p>Once the downloading is complete, you can launch the application from the Start menu.</p><p>Here are the steps to follow to record any screen on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Launch Screen Recorder Pro application from Start menu.</p><p>Step 2: You need to configure the parameters such as video encoder, FPS, quality, audio source and likewise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="launch screen recorder pro"                ></p><p>Step 3: You have to select full screen(monitor icon) or custom screen(area icon at the extreme right corner).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="screen recorder pro customize screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: Finally, click on Record button to start recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
