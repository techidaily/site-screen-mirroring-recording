Each external monitor will display identical images when turned on, but in order to move software windows between the two screens, you’ll have to enable the ‘Extend These Displays’ option. The actual steps you’ll need to take may vary, depending on the computer and the OS you are using, and we are going to show you how to extend displays on Windows 8 or later.</p><p>Head over to the Start Menu, and open the Control Panel. Select the ‘Adjust Screen Resolution’ option in the Appearance and Personalization menu, and then click on the Multiple Displays drop-down menu. Pick the ‘Extend These Displays’ option from the list and proceed to save the changes by clicking on the OK button.</p><h3 id="Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio"></a>Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio</h3><p>Widely accepted as one of the best open-source broadcasting and screen recording software ever created, OBS Studio also enables its users to record multiple screens simultaneously. The plug-in for the OBS called Simple Scene Switcher that detects on which monitor the mouse cursor is and that automatically switches between two monitors as you drag a mouse is a great option if you don’t want to record multiple displays at the same time. The plug-in lets you switch between windows without disrupting the flow of the video, which makes it particularly useful for LoL players and in numerous other situations. Here’s how you can record multiple monitors with OBS.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display"><a href="#Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Adding a Second Display"></a>Step 1 - Adding a Second Display</h4><p>Once you launch the software, you should use the right-click to access the software’s drop-down menu. Locate the Add feature and select the Display Capture option. Create&#x2F;Select Source window will pop-up, hit OK and once the Properties window appears on screen you should select your second monitor form the Display drop-down list. A new screen will emerge on the screen, and you can simply drag it to reposition it where you want.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution"><a href="#Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution"></a>Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution</h4><p>Go to OBS Studio’s main window and click on the Settings button in the lower right corner of the window. Select the Video option from the Settings menu, and then expand the Base (Canvas) Resolution bar.</p><p>Sum up the two values of the wider sides of the screens and insert the value you get into the Base Resolution bar. For example, if one monitor has a 1366X768 resolution and the second one has a 1024X768 resolution, you should add 1024 to the 1366 and insert the resulting value (2390) as the wide resolution value in Base Resolution Bar.</p><p>Save the changes you’ve made, and then drag the screens to arrange them. You can start recording multiple monitors with OBS Studio by clicking on the Start Recording button.</p><h3 id="Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia"><a href="#Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia"></a>Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia</h3><p>Selecting more than one monitor from the Camtasia’s Fullscreen settings is unfortunately not possible, but the Custom recording settings option allows you to capture footage from two different displays. You’ll need to make sure that both monitors are properly aligned and the that Extend These Displays feature is selected. Here’s how you record multiple monitors with Camtasia.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors"></a>Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Click on the Custom drop-down menu in Camtasia’s main window., and then click on the Select area to record option and proceed to designate the area of the multiple screens you want to record. You can accomplish this by clicking the left mouse button and dragging the boundary handles. Making the adjustments to the initial selections is also possible, even after you let go of the mouse key, but not during the screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video"></a>Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video</h4><p>Camtasia allows you to capture system audio, record sound from an external microphone, as well as to adjust the frame rate or the video resolution of the screen recording you are making. Hit the Record button when you are ready to start capturing footage from multiple monitors. The file you’ve created will be displayed in the software’s video editing mode, after the screencasting session is over, so you can remove unwanted parts of the video or add visual and text effects to your video.</p><h4 id="Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors"></a>Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Creating <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recordings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in high resolutions will use up a lot of the computer’s RAM memory, which can destabilize Camtasia’s video editor and cause it to crash. What’s more, if your computer doesn’t have a good graphics card, a lot of RAM memory and a great processor, the multiple monitor screen recordings may have a lag or even dropped frames. That’s the reason why you should make sure that your computer configuration is capable of capturing smooth screen recordings from multiple monitors, before starting your first screencasting session with multiple monitors.</p><p>In case that you want to record your secondary monitor, we recommend you to try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"

The methods of getting this done on the laptop computers are explained below in detail.</p><p>The following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background on Teams</strong> both before and during a video call while working on a Windows laptop. The step-by-step instructions are given below:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call"><a href="#Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call"></a>Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call</h3><p>If you have a meeting scheduled at a particular time but don’t know what to do with that homely background that wouldn’t go with the professional ambiance, luckily Microsoft Teams lets you blur it quite conveniently. The process is described as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Initiate a New Meeting Session</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams, and make sure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected in the left pane. From the top of the <strong>Chat</strong> pane, click the <strong>New Meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon, and click <strong>Start meeting</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams.jpg"                      alt="Start Microsoft Teams video call on Windows laptop"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Check the Devices</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Meeting with</strong> box, make sure that the <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> switches present under the preview screen are enabled.

If you’re using the Android phone or tablet, you may not blur the background on Teams video call. You can learn <strong>how to blur the background in Microsoft Teams</strong> while using an iOS device (iPhone X is used here for illustration) by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Start a New Meeting</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams on your iPhone or iPad, ensure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected from the bottom of the interface, tap the <strong>Instant meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the screen, and tap <strong>Start meeting</strong> from the bottom of the box that appears next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams-iphone.jpg"                      alt="start Microsoft Teams  call on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get to the Background Effects Screen</strong></p><p>On the next screen, tap to enable both <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> functions from the bottom, tap the <strong>More actions</strong> icon, and then tap <strong>Background effects</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-iphone-background-effects.jpg"                      alt="blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Blur the Background</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Select background</strong> screen, tap <strong>Blur</strong> from the options available in the box at the bottom, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner to apply the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-teams-video-call-background-iphone.jpg"                      alt="blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background"><a href="#FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background"></a>FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?</strong></p><p><strong>A1)</strong> If you’re unable to see the ‘Blur’ tile or the ‘Background settings’ option altogether, probably your PC doesn’t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease.

Most WhatsApp users use calling feature for personal communication. However, even corporates use WhatsApp to talk to team members and have a quick discussion. One of the common questions we come across from WhatsApp users “Can WhatsApp call be recorded?”</p><p>However, there is no default call recording option available. Therefore, you will need an external <strong>WhatsApp call recording app</strong> if you want to record your call on your Phone. Similarly, you will need an external software to record WhatsApp call on your computer. In this article, we will illustrate how to record a WhatsApp call in simple steps.</p><p>Way 1. <a href="#part1">How to Record WhatsApp Call on PC</a></p><p>Way 2. <a href="#part2">Record a WhatsApp Call on Android</a></p><p>Way 3. <a href="#part3">Record WhatsApp Video Call on iPhone</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-WhatsApp-Call-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-WhatsApp-Call-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to Record WhatsApp Call on PC?</h2><p>Do you know that you can download WhatsApp for Windows or Mac, and you can enjoy WhatsApp video calling feature directly from your computer? You should visit whatsapp.com&#x2F;download from the web browser of your computer and download and install WhatsApp for Desktop. Connect your WhatsApp account, and you can receive WhatsApp call from your WhatsApp contact anytime you want.</p><p>WhatsApp for Desktop or WhatsApp for Web has limited features. You cannot make calls, but you can receive calls. If you want all the features on your computer, you have to install WhatsApp through simulators like BlueStacks. If you want to record WhatsApp call on your computer, you need a WhatsApp call recorder. We recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to record anything on the screen with audio including WhatsApp video calls.

How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?"></a>Part 2. How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?</h2><p>WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts. Due to its usage more for personal communication over professional communication, there is no WhatsApp record feature available for security and privacy reason.</p><p>That is why you will need an external screen recorder app and we recommend AZ Screen Recorder. The app is free to use and very easy to operate. With a single tap, you can record anything on the screen including WhatsApp call. Here are the steps to follow to record WhatsApp call on Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store from your Android device and install AZ Screen Recorder app.</p><p>Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and the app will provide you with a pop-up overlay bar on the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open WhatsApp and go to the conversation of the person whom you want to video call.</p><p>Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder bar, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start your WhatsApp video call. Thereafter, the app will start recording the screen which is your WhatsApp video call in this case.</p><p>Step 5: When you have finished your video call, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder bar. The recorded video file will be available in the phone gallery.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-WhatsApp-Video-Call-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-WhatsApp-Video-Call-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Record WhatsApp Video Call on iPhone?"></a>Part 3. How to Record WhatsApp Video Call on iPhone?</h2><p>There are two options available for iPhone users depending on iOS version of your iPhone.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Command-Conquer-Triumphant-Tales-of-the-Best-7-Total-Wars"><a href="#Command-Conquer-Triumphant-Tales-of-the-Best-7-Total-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Command &amp; Conquer: Triumphant Tales of the Best 7 Total Wars"></a>Command &amp; Conquer: Triumphant Tales of the Best 7 Total Wars</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun "></a>1.Attila the Hun <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></h3><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War "></a>2.Rome 2 Total War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></h3><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War "></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></h3><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall "></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></h3><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2 "></a>5.Warhammer 2 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></h3><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2 "></a>6.Total War Medieval 2 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></h3><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War "></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></h3><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Try It Free"                > <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Commanders’-Canvas-Painting-Victory-in-the-Top-7-Total-Wars"><a href="#Commanders’-Canvas-Painting-Victory-in-the-Top-7-Total-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Commanders’ Canvas: Painting Victory in the Top 7 Total Wars"></a>Commanders’ Canvas: Painting Victory in the Top 7 Total Wars</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun "></a>1.Attila the Hun <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></h3><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War "></a>2.Rome 2 Total War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></h3><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War "></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></h3><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it.

The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2.

At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War-3"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War "></a>2.Rome 2 Total War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></h3><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War-3"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War "></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></h3><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall-3"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall "></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></h3><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2-3"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2 "></a>5.Warhammer 2 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></h3><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2-3"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2 "></a>6.Total War Medieval 2 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></h3><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders.

Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother.

Commonly screencasts are created by recording a single monitor, but some screen recording software products allow their users to capture footage from two different displays simultaneously.</p><p>If you would like to capture footage from multiple monitors, but you are not sure how, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to show you how to record two monitors at the same time using the OBS Studio and Camtasia screen recording software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                > Secure Download</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-Multiple-Monitors-1"><a href="#How-to-Record-Multiple-Monitors-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Record Multiple Monitors"></a>How to Record Multiple Monitors</h2><p>The first step towards setting up a screencasting session with multiple displays is to make sure that the monitors are properly connected to your laptop or desktop computer. Each external monitor will display identical images when turned on, but in order to move software windows between the two screens, you’ll have to enable the ‘Extend These Displays’ option. The actual steps you’ll need to take may vary, depending on the computer and the OS you are using, and we are going to show you how to extend displays on Windows 8 or later.</p><p>Head over to the Start Menu, and open the Control Panel. Select the ‘Adjust Screen Resolution’ option in the Appearance and Personalization menu, and then click on the Multiple Displays drop-down menu. Pick the ‘Extend These Displays’ option from the list and proceed to save the changes by clicking on the OK button.</p><h3 id="Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio"></a>Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio</h3><p>Widely accepted as one of the best open-source broadcasting and screen recording software ever created, OBS Studio also enables its users to record multiple screens simultaneously. The plug-in for the OBS called Simple Scene Switcher that detects on which monitor the mouse cursor is and that automatically switches between two monitors as you drag a mouse is a great option if you don’t want to record multiple displays at the same time. The plug-in lets you switch between windows without disrupting the flow of the video, which makes it particularly useful for LoL players and in numerous other situations. Here’s how you can record multiple monitors with OBS.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display"><a href="#Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Adding a Second Display"></a>Step 1 - Adding a Second Display</h4><p>Once you launch the software, you should use the right-click to access the software’s drop-down menu. Locate the Add feature and select the Display Capture option. Create&#x2F;Select Source window will pop-up, hit OK and once the Properties window appears on screen you should select your second monitor form the Display drop-down list. A new screen will emerge on the screen, and you can simply drag it to reposition it where you want.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution"><a href="#Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution"></a>Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution</h4><p>Go to OBS Studio’s main window and click on the Settings button in the lower right corner of the window. Select the Video option from the Settings menu, and then expand the Base (Canvas) Resolution bar.</p><p>Sum up the two values of the wider sides of the screens and insert the value you get into the Base Resolution bar. For example, if one monitor has a 1366X768 resolution and the second one has a 1024X768 resolution, you should add 1024 to the 1366 and insert the resulting value (2390) as the wide resolution value in Base Resolution Bar.</p><p>Save the changes you’ve made, and then drag the screens to arrange them. You can start recording multiple monitors with OBS Studio by clicking on the Start Recording button.</p><h3 id="Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia"><a href="#Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia"></a>Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia</h3><p>Selecting more than one monitor from the Camtasia’s Fullscreen settings is unfortunately not possible, but the Custom recording settings option allows you to capture footage from two different displays. You’ll need to make sure that both monitors are properly aligned and the that Extend These Displays feature is selected. Here’s how you record multiple monitors with Camtasia.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors"></a>Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Click on the Custom drop-down menu in Camtasia’s main window., and then click on the Select area to record option and proceed to designate the area of the multiple screens you want to record. You can accomplish this by clicking the left mouse button and dragging the boundary handles. Making the adjustments to the initial selections is also possible, even after you let go of the mouse key, but not during the screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video"></a>Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video</h4><p>Camtasia allows you to capture system audio, record sound from an external microphone, as well as to adjust the frame rate or the video resolution of the screen recording you are making. Hit the Record button when you are ready to start capturing footage from multiple monitors. The file you’ve created will be displayed in the software’s video editing mode, after the screencasting session is over, so you can remove unwanted parts of the video or add visual and text effects to your video.</p><h4 id="Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors"></a>Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Creating <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recordings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in high resolutions will use up a lot of the computer’s RAM memory, which can destabilize Camtasia’s video editor and cause it to crash. What’s more, if your computer doesn’t have a good graphics card, a lot of RAM memory and a great processor, the multiple monitor screen recordings may have a lag or even dropped frames. That’s the reason why you should make sure that your computer configuration is capable of capturing smooth screen recordings from multiple monitors, before starting your first screencasting session with multiple monitors.</p><p>In case that you want to record your secondary monitor, we recommend you to try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><ul><li>Able to record Primary and Secondary Display</li><li>Able to Record Desktop Screen And Webcam Simultaneously</li><li>Able to Record Computer Audio And Voice Over</li><li>Splendid Annotations, Cursor Effects and Editing Features</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-obs-optimization-for-seamless-fb-broadcasting-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] OBS Optimization for Seamless FB Broadcasting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-best-of-the-best-androids-top-8-group-chatters/"><u>2024 Approved  The Best of the Best  Android's Top 8 Group Chatters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/comprehensive-list-of-zoom-transcription-software-freepaid/"><u>Comprehensive List of Zoom Transcription Software (Free/Paid)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-cutting-edge-screen-shifting-for-editors/"><u>[New] Cutting-Edge Screen Shifting for Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/exitingmycam-entry-to-exceptionalcameras-for-2024/"><u>ExitingMyCam  Entry to ExceptionalCameras for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-exceptional-windows-calls-8-highest-rated/"><u>[Updated] Exceptional Windows Calls  8 Highest Rated</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-integrated-technique-for-cross-platform-movie-logging/"><u>In 2024, Integrated Technique for Cross-Platform Movie Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-virtual-venue-verdict-which-streamer-prevails/"><u>[New] In 2024, Virtual Venue Verdict  Which Streamer Prevails?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-how-to-securely-document-whatsapp-discussions/"><u>[New] How to Securely Document WhatsApp Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-get-the-rare-candy-on-pokemon-go-fire-red-on-google-pixel-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Google Pixel 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-approaches-for-iphoneipad-screen-capture/"><u>Cutting-Edge Approaches for iPhone/iPad Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-zte-blade-a73-5g-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top Apps and Online Tools To Track ZTE Blade A73 5G Phone With/Without IMEI Number</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-playbook-iphone-downloading-for-podcast-enthusiasts/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Playbook  IPhone Downloading for Podcast Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/unlocking-great-sound-audio-editing-techniques-in-fcp-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Great Sound Audio Editing Techniques in FCP for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-grasping-the-essence-of-discord-nitro-why-it-matters-and-how-to-claim-it-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Grasping the Essence of Discord Nitro -

Mainstreaming enables you to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube or stream on Twitch and Facebook, or all three! At the same time, with everyone spending more time indoors amid the global crisis, it appears we’re all seeking a diversion and many gamers are asking themselves how to broadcast on YouTube or Twitch. One of the easiest methods to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube Gaming at the same time is via OBS. Streamers may broadcast to more than 30 streaming platforms concurrently using an easy-to-understand user interface. The service is created in a manner that won’t place any demand on your PC hardware or the bandwidth you have available.</p><p>Well, it all boils down to choosing. But if you want to know the streaming networks with the highest traffic, those platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Twitch is a mainstreaming service that enables you to broadcast on more than 30 of your favorite platforms simultaneously. It merely takes a few minutes to join your numerous live streaming accounts and interact directly with the popular encoding program OBS. You may also multi streams on Twitch and your other favorite streaming services. Knowing what the correct gear is when you’re starting as a streamer may be intimidating, but we come with good news. Nowadays the entry-level for streaming has reduced quite a bit owing to hardware becoming more affordable, but also because many PCs are already prepared to manage a broadcast or can be readily updated to support one.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS"></a>Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS</h2><p>If you want to obtain the very greatest quality broadcast, you’re searching for some fantastic software. In the case of Windows, one of the most common solutions is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) (OBS). Many people are first drawn to OBS since it’s free to use owing to being open source. Luckily, it’s also a feature-rich piece of software that can handle practically anything you throw at it. If you’re new to OBS or to streaming in general, it might be a bit frightening at first.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch"><a href="#Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch"></a>Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch</h3><p>Before you stream anything anyplace, you need to provide OBS with the credentials to broadcast on your channel. Exactly how you do this on the large number of services OBS supports may differ, but I’m covering Twitch for this instruction.</p><p>In all circumstances, you need to either produce a stream key in your account settings on the appropriate provider or link your account to OBS if it’s supported like it is on Twitch. Simply signing in with your credentials is by far the simplest approach, and OBS utilizes streaming, so you’re not providing any of your personal login information directly to it. YouTube likewise offers a similar kind of authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch.jpg"                      alt="twitch"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS"><a href="#Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS"></a>Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS</h3><p>OBS Studio is available for all main operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, and, Linux. You may get the utility by clicking here. Run and install the software to get started. When you launch the program for the first time, OBS Studio performs an Auto-Configuration Wizard. It provides you the choice of selecting between ‘Optimize for streaming’ and ‘Optimize for recording’. Click on the ‘Optimize for streaming’ if you wish to live broadcast your game. The wizard will next examine your system’s performance. It examines and helps adjust your system resolution, bitrate, encoder, and internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/installing-and-setting-obs.jpg"                      alt="installing and setting obs"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch"><a href="#Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch"></a>Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch</h3><p>Now that you’re set up to the stream, the first step is to select your resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. The greater each of them, the more bandwidth and horsepower you’ll require from your PC. If you’ve got a high-speed internet connection and a strong PC, then you can probably stream at 1080p60 at a high bitrate. But you also need to balance this with offering a stream that’s not going to buffer like wild for your viewers who could be on poorer connections. Remember, if you’re not a partner on Twitch, you won’t have transcoding, thus the experience might be awful for viewers with sluggish connections.</p><p>Once you’re done setting up OBS, you can dig into the advanced capabilities such as OBS sceneries. These will allow you to dramatically boost your live stream production value. If you arrange your OBS scenes and sources appropriately, your broadcast may go from an ordinary-looking stream to one that appears slick and professional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configuring-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configuring obs studio"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources"></a>Step 4. Adding Scene and Sources</h3><p>A scene may be simply added in OBS by clicking on the addition symbol indicated in the picture below. Once you have chosen this, you will simply be prompted to pick a name for the scene. All of your overlays, sources, and basic on-screen items will need to be introduced through a specified scene. Once you have created your scene and titled it, make sure it is chosen and proceed to the box on the right side of the picture below to click the plus symbol. This brings up the many sources you may pick from for your freshly constructed scenario. The good thing is, once you have inserted a source in one scene, you can simply use it again in another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adding-scene-and-sources.jpg"                      alt="adding scene and sources"                ></p><h3 id="Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat"><a href="#Step-5-Adding-a-Twitch-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat"></a>Step 5. Adding a Twitch Chat</h3><p>Adding your twitch chat to your broadcasts may help make your viewers feel more included by enabling them to see their message live on the screen. You may add your Twitch chat box to your live broadcast in OBS by utilizing the browser source. The best practice when employing a chat box is to make sure to have your visuals, displays, and overlays set up to accommodate it. Get the widget URL from your favorite provider and copy it to your clipboard. This is what you will be adding to your OBS sources to add the chat to your overlay. If you’re using Twitch, this will be provided to you once you pick your basic settings for your chat style and layout. In the “Sources” section of OBS, go to the “+” in the bottom left corner, and pick, “Browser” to create a new browser source window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch-chat.jpg"                      alt="twitch chat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS"></a>Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS</h2><p>You may get it by browsing OBS Studio’s official website. If you’re using Windows 11, you shouldn’t be concerned about compatibility, since OBS is completely tuned to function with it. You may also broadcast game videos on YouTube. YouTube Gaming is a service devoted to gaming content providers and their viewers. Similar to Twitch and Facebook Gaming, it’s YouTube’s area for the gaming community. Once you’re done downloading and installing OBS, run it. You should be welcomed with a window with a dark screen and objects below it.</p><p>**<strong>Get your YouTube Stream Key</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a YouTube account if you haven’t already</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> You can’t participate in YouTube live broadcasting unless you authenticate the account using a connected cell phone. Head to the verification page, log in to your account and follow the on-screen steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamkey.jpg"                      alt="streamkey"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Once authenticated, it’s time to travel to YouTube Studio. Choose the Camera icon on the upper right-hand side of the main YouTube page and then select Go Live.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/go-live.jpg"                      alt="go live"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 4:</strong> Now click Schedule Stream, and check to make sure that all the parameters are accurate and that the video is correctly labeled and described. When ready, choose Create Stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/schedule-stream.jpg"                      alt="schedule stream"                ></p><p>**<strong>Link OBS to YouTube</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Download OBS from the official website and install it like you would any other application.

Each audio device on that page represents one possible audio source in your broadcast. If you want viewers to hear in-game or desktop audio, assign one of the Desktop Audio options to your system’s audio output. If you want your viewers to hear you, pick your microphone from the drop-down next to Mic&#x2F;Auxiliary Audio.</p><p>**<strong>Step 4:</strong> In the main window, click the Plus symbol beneath the Sources heading near the bottom. If you wish to broadcast game video, choose Game Capture displayed on the pop-up menu. You have a couple of different choices for collecting your film. You may capture any full-screen program, a single window, or a foreground window. You may also enable transparency, capture third-party overlays, and more. Click OK to finish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-capture.jpg"                      alt="game capture"                ></p><p>**<strong>Start Streaming</strong></p><p>With all of the aforementioned settings in place and your YouTube channel ready to accept your broadcast, there’s only one thing to do: Start live streaming!

You can face difficulty with your YouTube live broadcast owing to problems with PC or internet performance. OBS enables you to access a log to discover a solution to your difficulties. OBS may broadcast videos to services that support real-time messaging protocol (RTMP), such as Twitch, Facebook Gaming, YouTube Gaming, and Instagram. But for gamers, it’s increasingly usual to broadcast on Twitch, Facebook, and YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-techniques-to-recover-from-obs-fullscreen-lockout/"><u>[New] In 2024, Techniques to Recover From OBS Fullscreen Lockout</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-virtual-swordplay-showdown-find-your-match-in-these-games/"><u>[Updated] Virtual Swordplay Showdown  Find Your Match in These Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-accessories-10-ps5-hard-drive-mods-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Accessories  #10 PS5 Hard Drive Mods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/vidmas-advantages-in-digital-video-recording-unpacked-for-2024/"><u>Vidma’s Advantages in Digital Video Recording Unpacked for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/behind-the-scenes-mastering-4-techniques-of-xbox-capture-for-2024/"><u>Behind the Scenes  Mastering 4 Techniques of Xbox Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-direct-transmission-of-television-streams-via-computer/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Direct Transmission of Television Streams via Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/quick-setup-for-flawless-time-lapses-on-ipad-for-2024/"><u>Quick Setup for Flawless Time-Lapses on iPad for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-rapidly-expanding-youtube-stars-for-inspiration/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling the Rapidly Expanding YouTube Stars for Inspiration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-japanese-aesthetics-on-the-go-applying-anime-filters-to-snaps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Japanese Aesthetics on the Go  Applying Anime Filters to Snaps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-expert-techniques-to-upload-strikingly-good-content-on-tiktok-via-mac-and-windows/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Expert Techniques to Upload Strikingly Good Content on TikTok via Mac and Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-chromecasts-full-potential-streaming-local-videos-on-windows-mac-android-and-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Chromecasts Full Potential Streaming Local Videos on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-keep-your-digital-life-streamlined-blocking-youtube-channels-smartly/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Keep Your Digital Life Streamlined  Blocking Youtube Channels Smartly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-speech-to-text-made-easy-conversion-methods-revealed/"><u>In 2024, Speech to Text Made Easy Conversion Methods Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/the-basic-routes-to-sync-obs-with-zoom-for-2024/"><u>The Basic Routes to Sync OBS with Zoom for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-access-to-top-15-android-virtualization-apps-mac-and-pc/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Access to Top 15 Android Virtualization Apps (Mac & PC)</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Best Alternative to Active Presenter"></a>Part 4. Best Alternative to Active Presenter</h2><p>Active Presenter’s focus lies in creating software simulations, demos, and interactive slides rather than being a dedicated screen recorder of what most users expect. It’s pricing is high and its learning curve can be demanding. Furthermore, the video import option is limited. Therefore, we suggest Wondershare Filmora as an alternative to Active Presenter 8.</p><p>Filmora is a dedicated <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with an advanced video editing platform.

None, however, have been stretched as far as roguelikes and roguelites. You’ve probably heard these terms used to describe recent hit games such as <em>Hades</em>, <em>Dead Cells,</em> and <em>Binding of Isaac</em> and have wondered if there’s a difference. While both of these game types share a lot of common elements and the lines between them are seemingly blurred, there is a clear distinction between roguelikes and roguelites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/isaac-poster.jpg"                      alt="isaac-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>This article contains:</strong></p><hr><p>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</p><hr><h3 id="Rogue-Where-it-all-started"><a href="#Rogue-Where-it-all-started" class="headerlink" title="Rogue: Where it all started"></a>Rogue: Where it all started</h3><p>In order to best understand these two game genres, we must first analyze the origin of their namesakes. Way back in 1980, game designers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman released an ASCII art dungeon crawler called <em>Rogue</em>. Inspired by the pen-and-paper RPG <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this turn-based adventure game had players explore dungeons in which they fought monsters and gathered items to help them power up their characters. The game’s defining mechanic was <strong>permadeath</strong>. This meant that once your character died, it was literally the end. You couldn’t create a save nor revive your fallen hero in any way. Starting over meant a completely fresh game with a brand new character. What’s more is that starting a new game meant the dungeons were completely different, including enemy placement, room location, and item distribution. Every decision could mean either living and carrying on or dying and starting over, making the choices players made meaningful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/michael-toy-glenn-wichman.jpg"                      alt="michael-toy-glenn-wichman"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelike-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelike-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelike Game?"></a>What is a Roguelike Game?</h2><p>As the name implies, a roguelike - or roguelike - is a game that shares the same mechanics that defined <em>Rogue</em>. They have procedurally generated environments, making every playthrough feel completely fresh and different. Dying in a roguelike means all progress is lost, and you need to start over, no saves, no lives, no ifs nor buts. It’s at this juncture where some debate exists as to what truly defines a roguelike. There are fans out there who’ll tell you that a roguelike must not only share the mechanics but also the game’s layout and combat system. According to them, since <em>Rogue</em> was a top-down third-person turn-based RPG that played on a grid, all true roguelikes should then play and look the same. The other camp sees roguelikes as purely defined by true permadeath with some leniency afforded with regards to less important elements such as player perspective, combat systems, and screen orientation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rogue-poster.jpg"                      alt="rogue-poster"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelite-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelite-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelite Game?"></a>What is a Roguelite Game?</h2><p>Roguelites - or rogue-lites - in essence, employ a lighter approach to implementing <em>Rogue</em>‘s key characteristics. For the most part, roguelites still have permadeath. If you die, then you have to start over. However, the <strong>key difference</strong> is that roguelites allow you to carry over some form of progress from one playthrough to the next. Depending on the game, the way progress is carried over varies. Some games allow you to unlock additional items that can drop in a given run. Others open up access to new areas or provide you with abilities that enable you to traverse towards new locations and expand your area of exploration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-hades.jpg"                      alt="unlock-hades"                ></p><p>Roguelites also have procedurally generated environments in a lot of cases. There are titles that have completely random level layouts and enemy placements. Others draw from a pre-defined set of layouts that are mixed and matched. Some titles may simply randomize more minute elements such as item placement and the locations of points of interest. Another way roguelites differ in the way they handle procedural generation is through seeded runs. A seed is essentially a run with pre-determined parameters, including enemy types and placements, level layout, and item availability. Seeding is also used to generate special challenge runs as well as enable custom modes. Whatever the case, roguelites have a tendency to reign in the chaos of fully procedurally generated game content.</p><p>It’s roguelites that are also usually a mix of different genres with <em>Rogue</em> style mechanics. From action RPGs to card games, the roguelite genre’s offerings are quite expansive. The leniency they give when it comes to permadeath and randomness affords developers more design space in which they can craft unique experiences.</p><hr><h2 id="A-Clear-Distinction"><a href="#A-Clear-Distinction" class="headerlink" title="A Clear Distinction"></a>A Clear Distinction</h2><p>Regardless of where you stand on what defines a faithful roguelike, the distinction between it and roguelites is quite straightforward. You know you are playing a roguelike when dying means you <strong>lose it all</strong>. No matter how far into the game you’ve progressed, one misstep means all of the time and work you put into your progress has come to an end. Roguelites, on the other hand, prefer to give you <strong>some sense of progression</strong>, making them <strong>friendlier</strong> for players who don’t want to play with the stress of potentially losing everything.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that roguelikes give you a truly unique experience each time while roguelites end up becoming grindy and repetitive. When every little decision you make can lead you to lose your character and progress, you become more focused on your run, rather than the game as a whole. You’re forced to play your best, scrutinize every possible choice, and make meaningful comparisons between items and gear you come across. The risk is higher when playing roguelikes, but the reward and payoff of making it far in a run are quite big.</p><p>If you were to conclude that roguelikes are for the <strong>hardest of core gamers</strong> and roguelites are more <strong>casual</strong> in nature, you would be quite close to the mark. A lot of roguelite titles, however, have difficulty settings that can turn them into absolutely brutal experiences, rendering progress and unlocks less important than the player’s overall skill.</p><hr><p>Part 2: Examples of Roguelike and Roguelite Titles</p><p>If you’ve been meaning to dive into either or both of these genres, we’ve got a few titles for you to check out.</p><p><strong>You might also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Roguelike or Roguelite Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelike-Games"><a href="#Roguelike-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelike Games"></a>Roguelike Games</h3><p>For this list, we’re using the “true” definition of roguelike, meaning games that are almost exactly like <em>Rogue</em>.</p><h4 id="Nethack"><a href="#Nethack" class="headerlink" title="Nethack"></a>Nethack</h4><p><em>Nethack</em> is considered one of the most important roguelikes as it is as close to <em>Rogue</em> as a game can get. Apart from permadeath and procedurally generated environments, it shares a lot of <em>Rogue’s</em> core attributes, including the ASCII art style and screen layout. Compared to <em>Rogue</em>, <em>Nethack</em> has a much larger collection of enemies and items, making exploring its world more rewarding. <em>Nethack</em> also includes “conducts” which are special limitations players can choose to impose upon themselves in order to make the game even more challenging.</p><h4 id="Caves-of-Qud"><a href="#Caves-of-Qud" class="headerlink" title="Caves of Qud"></a>Caves of Qud</h4><p>Straying a bit from <em>Rogue’s</em> high fantasy setting, <em>Caves of Qud</em> mixes some science fiction into its world. Just like <em>Rogue</em>, dying means your progress goes caput. Environments, however, are only partially generated randomly, with some elements being pre-defined. The game also includes a robust mutation system to power up your character as well as quests and side-quests which you can choose to follow or ignore. On top of all this, <em>Caves of Qud</em> adds another layer of randomness through its procedurally generated political systems.</p><h4 id="Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</h4><p>Recognized as one of the best roguelikes of all time, <em>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</em> is one of the true innovators of its space. Taking all of the core defining elements of <em>Rogue</em>, including its hyper retro art style, <em>DCSS</em> makes a concerted effort towards being more accessible. For starters, it offers a more user-friendly interface that brings all important information to the forefront. The developers also wanted to make its gameplay far easier to understand so that any person can pick it up and play without needing any convoluted prior knowledge of how the game works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelite-Games"><a href="#Roguelite-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelite Games"></a>Roguelite Games</h3><p>For this genre, we’ve chosen three games that are completely different to illustrate the wider variety of titles that exists within the roguelite space.</p><h4 id="Dead-Cells"><a href="#Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Dead Cells"></a>Dead Cells</h4><p><em>Dead Cells</em> is an exploration-based action platformer (a.k.a. a metroidvania) with roguelite elements. Just like all _Rogue_-based games, dying in <em>Dead Cells</em> means you start over from the beginning. However, not <strong>all progress</strong> is lost. As you progress through various biomes of the game, you’ll unlock new traversal abilities that allow you to access new biomes and pathways. While some randomness exists in each biome, it feels less like levels are procedurally generated and more like a mixing of pre-determined layout components. You’ll also stumble upon blueprints for items which you can then spend Cells you gather to make the items available to drop in future runs. By beating the game’s final boss you can unlock progressively harder difficulties, making the game increasingly more brutal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><h4 id="Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="Slay the Spire"></a>Slay the Spire</h4><p>One of the most highly praised indie games, MegaCrit’s <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a shining example of a perfect blend of genres. It’s a deckbuilding card game where you must climb the titular Spire while defeating enemies and bosses in turn-based card battles, so you can ultimately slay its heart. Each run consists of 3 Acts, each of which gives you choices of pathways that are procedurally generated. While enemy placement is somewhat controlled at first, it becomes more truly random the higher you climb. What makes StS particularly challenging is that it affords very few options to restore health so guarding your HP is vital. While death does mean you’ll have to start all the way from the bottom, you can unlock new cards for each of the game’s 4 classes as you level them up. The game also offers a wide variety of options for challenges and seeded custom runs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><h4 id="Hades"><a href="#Hades" class="headerlink" title="Hades"></a>Hades</h4><p>Nominated for a Game of the Year award, <em>Hades</em> is a beloved title that has converted many gamers to the roguelite genre. Your aim in the game, as the son of Hades, is to escape the Ancient Greek hell and ascend to the top of Olympus with the rest of the pantheon. The gameplay is fast-paced action hack-and-slash but it’s in a top-down perspective which makes it feel a lot closer to <em>Rogue</em> than other games in the genre. It also has a lot of elements that are randomized, including the location of helpful shops. Your build will also feel wildly different between runs as even the Gods that appear to power you up are random as well as the abilities they offer you to choose from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirror-hades.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> With thousand of effects, Filmora X help you record your gameplay and edit it into nice montage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-secrets-unveiled-the-ultimate-guide-to-recording-games/"><u>[Updated] Secrets Unveiled  The Ultimate Guide to Recording Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-clearview-pro-5-screen-mastery-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] ClearView Pro 5 - Screen Mastery for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-tips-efficiently-capturing-moments-with-snap-features-in-meet/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Quick Tips  Efficiently Capturing Moments with Snap Features in Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-techs-choice-best-online-screen-capturing-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tech's Choice  Best Online Screen Capturing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-integrated-media-and-live-stream-services-from-ms-videospace/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Integrated Media & Live Stream Services From MS VideoSpace</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-video-host-vs-stream-pro-the-battle-of-obs-and-twitch-studio/"><u>2024 Approved  Video Host Vs.

The processing would be too slow for all the commercial games of the Nintendo 3DS, though 3DMOO supports all of them. The game might crash frequently, ruining your gaming experience.

Performance and Requirements"></a>Part 3. Performance and Requirements</h2><p>There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources.

Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.</p><p>However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.</p><p>NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.
