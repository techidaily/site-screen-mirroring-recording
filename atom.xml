So, if someone has started sharing the screen on your turn or there is some error, you can send a signal to the participant by sharing your screen during their presentation.</p><p>Thus, Google Meet does not restrict other members from sharing screens when already one screen is shared. You can easily share your screen during someone else’s presentation by following a couple of steps below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Join-a-video-conference"><a href="#Step-1-Join-a-video-conference" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Join a video conference"></a>Step 1: Join a video conference</h3><p>Connect to the video conference through the invitation link or code.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: you may create your own meeting if you are hosting a conference.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Start-presenting"><a href="#Step-2-Start-presenting" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start presenting"></a>Step 2: Start presenting</h3><p>Click the <strong>Present</strong> <strong>Now</strong> to share the screen based on your need.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-3-Confirm-the-action"><a href="#Step-3-Confirm-the-action" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Confirm the action"></a>Step 3: Confirm the action</h3><p>Choose <strong>the Share now</strong> option when a pop-up notification appears, and then your screen will be shared on the meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-as-presenter-on-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen on Google Meet when someone else is presenting"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The other member presenting will find his presentation paused till you do not end your presentation and cancel screen sharing.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Share-Screen-and-Presentation-without-Participating"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Share-Screen-and-Presentation-without-Participating" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Share Screen and Presentation without Participating?"></a>Part 5: How to Share Screen and Presentation without Participating?</h2><p>Google Meet is usually used for video-conferencing between students, colleagues, or business partners. However, it is not obvious that you only use Google Meet to participate in the discussion. There can be a situation when you don’t want to join a video session formally yet need to share a presentation. The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let’s know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting"></a>Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting</h3><p>Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click <strong>start a meeting</strong>.</p><p>Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating"><a href="#Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Share screen without participating"></a>Step 2: Share screen without participating</h3><p>Tap <strong>Present</strong> and select a preferred window to share.

There is no exception for Google Meet. So, you can use all its features, and even access it through any other browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature. Although the process is almost the same as in Google Chrome, users may find a slightly different interface when joining through other browsers.

OBS virtual camera enables you to utilize a media resource such as video files, screenshots, apps, games, etc. as the camera output to Meet, or other Video conversations. Your conference partner will see the video source you just specified instead of your face via the camera. One of the most typical concerns that streamers would run across is that their video would, over time, become out of sync with the rest of the broadcast. For example, your microphone audio could line up with your lips at first, but there is a perceptible offset from the camera one hour into a broadcast. Luckily, these video sync difficulties with OBS are generally caused by a sampling rate mismatch. Thanks to its basic well-organized user interface, OBS is pretty easy to use and it operates smoothly as well.</p><p>Assuming you are a post for freeware that can do screen recording properly and profitably, an OBS screen recorder is warmly encouraged. Even better, its outstanding ability is to cope with live spillage by supporting numerous popular web-based features. In video conferencing software like Skype, Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, or Facebook Messenger Rooms, you may notice a video source issue labeled “OBS camera not showing” in the OBS Studio. And you may question what it is and how to utilize the virtual camera Virtually every streamer around the world knows about OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), a free open-sourced streaming and recording application.

However, if you have added a small mod, it might not support Boss Checklist because it depends upon the permission provided by each mod to Boss Checklist to access the progress.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Keep record of everything you do</li><li>Check what you have accomplished</li><li>Check what you have to accomplish</li><li>Keep record of every boss you kill</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Filmora-Best-Game-Video-Recorder-and-Editor"><a href="#Filmora-Best-Game-Video-Recorder-and-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Filmora - Best Game Video Recorder and Editor"></a>Filmora - Best Game Video Recorder and Editor</h3><ul><li>Record game videos on your computer with audio and webcam.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quickly with a wide range of gaming effects.</li><li>Rich video tempaltes and resources for game videos.</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4><p>It is fun to play Terraria but the fun and thrill will be doubled by adding the above mods.

It’s extremely simple to utilize with numerous social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook Live, and Twitch. Today, we will teach you how to link OBS Studio with Facebook Live and start broadcasting in no time. You may embed scene sources inside scene sources so that the user can control what’s occurring. Using this will enable you to represent a certain scenario throughout a historical period. Nesting sceneries enable you to edit one portion of a scene without having to go through the full scenario. OBS Studio takes your web camera, microphone, and other devices as inputs and works well on all Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It has a big community, which assures a steady supply of filters, transition effects, overlays, and help if you ever have trouble when working the program.</p><p>On Facebook Live, it’s very simple to generate high-quality live streaming nowadays, but effective live broadcasts take a little know-how and technical knowledge or understanding. OBS Studio allows you to communicate with your Facebook network via HD live streaming. It allows you to make your live broadcasts seem professional and leave a lasting impression. Open Broadcaster Software Studio is a free live streaming application with cross-platform interoperability. It gives you extensive customization choices, enabling you to manage every element of video recording and streaming. In addition to video recording and streaming, OBS can also allow you to capture your computer screen and live stream gameplays in high quality. The program provides a customizable UI to match your needs simply. Many of the OBS features match those seen in paid products. Here, we’ve put together our best advice for maximizing OBS settings for live broadcasting.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Audio-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Audio-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Audio Recorder"></a>Filmora Audio Recorder</h5><p>Record computer system audio</p><p>Capture microphone audio</p><p>Customize recording volume</p><p>Record screen and webcam as well</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings"></a>Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings</h2><p>OBS Studio provides several wonderful tools for beginner broadcasters who are just getting the swing of live broadcasting. The program contains a set of OBS-specific system requirements to guarantee the most optimum live broadcasting experience. These options include the ability to mix several sources with unique transitions, employ audio&#x2F;video filters and correction tools, and more. First, access the OBS Studio settings by selecting the “Settings” button in the bottom-right region of the program window. The first tab, named “General,” doesn’t include anything particularly significant to examine. However, here, you may pick your language and choose a bright or dark theme.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings"><a href="#Steps-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings"></a>Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you’ve evaluated these options, click on the next tab labeled “Stream” in the OBS Studio settings box. Game capture is suggested for live streaming since it is designed for recording screen material as well as capturing video. Multiple sources may be utilized as scenes, and they can be made visible or invisible with the touch of a button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-obs-stream-settings.jpg"                      alt="set up obs stream settings"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> As soon as you run OBS, you are greeted with the auto-config window, which automatically picks various choices for you based on how you want to use it. The auto-configuration settings may be toggled again by clicking on Tools -&gt; Auto-Configuration Wizard. However, your connection speed may be too slow to handle this bitrate. You may simply confirm whether this is the case by running a speed test.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tools.jpg"                      alt="tools"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> On the top, we have the primary canvas showcasing all material to be captured or broadcast. We may add as many sources as we need. There are several choices for visual sources as well as audio channels. By default, the resolution is the same as the laptop screen. At the bottom, various sceneries may be specified. Scenes comprise multiple sources that may be utilized to capture or broadcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-or-broadcast.jpg"                      alt="capture or broadcast"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Connect-OBS-to-Facebook-Live"><a href="#Part-2-Connect-OBS-to-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connect OBS to Facebook Live"></a>Part 2: Connect OBS to Facebook Live</h2><p>OBS Studio can broadcast your videos on all the main streaming networks, including Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Live, and more than 30 similar services. When you live stream on Facebook with OBS Studio, you may experience the host of visual mixing and customization tools of OBS Studio. To alter your OBS Studio settings, you will have to visit the “Output “settings in your OBS Studio account.</p><p>By default, the chosen output mode is “Simple.” To guarantee your live broadcast is reliable and completely functioning we suggest you follow the configuration options offered in the “Encoder Setup” box. The technique to combine OBS Studio and Facebook is pretty straightforward and comprises the following stages.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Facebook-Live"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Facebook Live"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Facebook Live</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio.
