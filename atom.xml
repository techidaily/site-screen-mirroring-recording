Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.</p><p>Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo.

When he befriends you, he can begin considering making a move into town. The move to town will make Leo more accessible. In all, Leo is simply a child that will manage to successfully befriend Jas and Vincent whenever he is fully settled in the new home in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h2 id="Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>Some of the intriguing addition players will love in Stardew Valley Ginger Island include:</p><h3 id="1-Volcano-dungeon"><a href="#1-Volcano-dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Volcano dungeon"></a>1.Volcano dungeon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon"                ></p><p>This is regarded as an enormous draw for adventurous players.

To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="High-Definition-Recordings-Picking-the-Best-Frame-Rate-Wisely"><a href="#High-Definition-Recordings-Picking-the-Best-Frame-Rate-Wisely" class="headerlink" title="High-Definition Recordings: Picking the Best Frame Rate Wisely"></a>High-Definition Recordings: Picking the Best Frame Rate Wisely</h2><p>You probably didn’t anticipate coming across so many technical terms when you first started recording videos. You only wanted to make quality content you know your audience will enjoy. Now you are hearing phrases like frame rate being tossed around, leaving you a bit intimidated.</p><p>After all, you want your videos to be the best they can ever be, don’t you? Plenty of thought and consideration goes into making a high-quality video for YouTube or any other social media platform where your audience will watch it. Therefore, educating yourself and applying the knowledge accordingly would be wise.</p><p>Keep reading this article to learn more about FPS in video recording and how to choose the best frame rate.</p><h2 id="Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording"><a href="#Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Overview of FPS in Video Recording"></a>Overview of FPS in Video Recording</h2><p>A video works very similarly to a flipbook, which contains a series of still images. When you view these images at a certain speed, the animation unfolds, giving the illusion that the images are moving. Each image is known as a frame, and the frame rate is the speed at which the frames move. Frame rate is usually expressed as “frames per second,” or FPS in short.</p><p>If a video is set to play at 24fps, it means there are 24 frames in every second the video plays. Technology is very nifty and can trick your brain into the idea that animation flows smoothly. However, if the video were slowed down, you would notice that the motion is not as smooth as it seems. This smooth motion enables you to enjoy the video without hiccups or disruptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-recording-fps.jpg"                      alt="fps in video recording"                ></p><p>In addition to influencing your audience’s viewing experience, the frame rate also affects how realistic you want your video to be. An FPS of 24 is ideal for movies because the motion is similar to how we see the world.</p><p>On the other hand, sporting events and video games require a higher frame rate to accommodate all the events happening simultaneously. The high frame rate also keeps the details crisp and ensures the motion is as smooth as possible. You wouldn’t want to watch a football match where the motion cuts every three minutes.</p><p>A lower FPS is ideal if you want to blur the video or use techniques like slow motion in the video. You could also opt for a lower FPS if you’re creating animated GIFs. Remember, you can’t make your GIF too large. Therefore, you would rather sacrifice detail and fluid motion and choose a low frame rate with a smaller size.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?"></a>What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a rule set in stone that will guide you in choosing a frame rate. In fact, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding which frame rate will give your audience the best viewing experience. Research won’t yield the answers you are looking for since there are points to support just about any frame rate you google.</p><p>The simple fact is that different FPS will yield different results, meaning there is no perfect frame rate. The option you choose for your videos will depend on your unique needs and the type of content you want to create. However, there are a few factors you need to consider before you pick the best fps to record video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-recording-video-fps.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing fps in video recording"                ></p><h4 id="Motion"><a href="#Motion" class="headerlink" title="Motion"></a>Motion</h4><p>If your video contains a lot of movement, it would be wise to stick to a higher frame rate to keep the motion crisp. We also urge you to capture the video at a higher frame rate for increased editing flexibility.</p><h4 id="Realism"><a href="#Realism" class="headerlink" title="Realism"></a>Realism</h4><p>Even though movies are fictitious, the concept should be tied to how we naturally see the world. For instance, when a person throws a ball, we see a bit of blur as the object moves in the air. Therefore, the frame rate you choose should mimic this motion blur and make your video more realistic.</p><h4 id="Delivery"><a href="#Delivery" class="headerlink" title="Delivery"></a>Delivery</h4><p>You can be lax about the frame rate if you want to deliver the video on the Internet because the viewers are a bit forgiving. However, we urge you to stick to 24fps if you project a movie in the theatre to give it a cinematic look. On the other hand, the best frame rate for recording video for TV would be between 24 to 30fps.</p><h3 id="File-size-and-export-time"><a href="#File-size-and-export-time" class="headerlink" title="File size and export time"></a>File size and export time</h3><p>Last but not least, it would be wise to consider the ideal file size for your video and how long it will take to export it. A higher frame rate means more still images are packed into one second of the video. The file size automatically increases, and you will notice that it takes longer to export your videos to platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.</p><h2 id="30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?"></a>30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?</h2><p>By now, you understand that 30fps means that 30 still images are packed into one second of the video. The same principle applies to 60fps. You will see 30 fps in soap operas, television, and live broadcasts. The shots in this frame rate are more detailed, even though they give the video an unrealistic feel because that isn’t how we naturally view the world.</p><p>On the other hand, 60fps is commonly used in fast-paced videos where you need enough frames to accommodate the action and enjoy the video. However, more filmmakers and directors are incorporating 60 fps in their videos to make the motion look smooth. Have you ever wondered how a slow-motion scene looks so crisp even when the camera zooms in on the actor? A 60-fps frame rate is the answer!</p><p>The debate still continues and people continue to compare 30 vs 60 fps video recording. As we mentioned earlier, there is no ideal fps recording. It all depends on what you want to do with your video.</p><p>For instance, if you want a slow-motion scene with little to no motion blur, then you are better off choosing 60 FPS. You could also choose a higher frame rate when shooting at concerts where a lot is happening at once.</p><p>However, smoothness is not always the best. You are better off sticking to realistic shots for movies or TV shows because that is what day-to-day life looks like. Therefore, 30 FPS is the best choice. An even lower frame rate would work if you want your movie to have a jittery feel or you want to insert a comedic feel into your content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/30-60-fps-video-recording.jpg"                      alt="30 vs 60 fps video recording"                ></p><h2 id="Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording"><a href="#Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?"></a>Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?</h2><p>It wouldn’t be a great idea to jump into choosing a high frame rate for your video without understanding what it means or how it will affect the viewing experience.</p><p>Remember, a higher frame rate is not always the best fps for recording video. It might also do more harm than good and leave your video in shambles. You wouldn’t want to go back to the drawing board because you jumped on the bandwagon of choosing a high fps for the sake of it.</p><p>We urge you to do your homework and find out which frame rate works best for the content you want to create. A high fps recording also means your file will be bigger and take longer than usual to export.</p><p>A higher FPS isn’t the ideal choice if you are not willing to deal with a large file size. Another crucial factor to consider would be the viewing experience for your audience.</p><h2 id="How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS"><a href="#How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS" class="headerlink" title="How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?"></a>How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?</h2><p>Developers have been working tirelessly to create apps to help content creators and filmmakers like yourself record and edit their videos.

Apart from playing offline videos, VLC Media Player lets you stream videos from online sources as well as convert videos into different file formats. Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is <strong>VLC rotate video</strong> and save the video file.</p><p>You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="History’s-Heaviest-Battles-RTS-Review-of-7-Epic-Games"><a href="#History’s-Heaviest-Battles-RTS-Review-of-7-Epic-Games" class="headerlink" title="History’s Heaviest Battles: RTS Review of 7 Epic Games"></a>History’s Heaviest Battles: RTS Review of 7 Epic Games</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun"></a>1.Attila the Hun</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War"></a>2.Rome 2 Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War"></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2"></a>5.Warhammer 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2"></a>6.Total War Medieval 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War"></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2-3"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2"></a>5.Warhammer 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development. The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2-3"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2"></a>6.Total War Medieval 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War-3"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War"></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt;

Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 is a completely free screen recording app. The app does not have any premium service to upgrade.

How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>The features of the application seem to be great for capturing any screen activities. Besides, there are various advanced options available such as record specific areas or record without cursor. These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording. Here are the steps to download –</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Microsoft Store.</p><p>Step 2: Search for “screen recorder pro for win10”.</p><p>Step 3: Select the first app from the search result page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-recorder-pro-store.jpg"                      alt="search recorder from store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Get button to download and install Screen Recorder Pro APK automatically.</p><p>Once the downloading is complete, you can launch the application from the Start menu.</p><p>Here are the steps to follow to record any screen on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Launch Screen Recorder Pro application from Start menu.</p><p>Step 2: You need to configure the parameters such as video encoder, FPS, quality, audio source and likewise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="launch screen recorder pro"                ></p><p>Step 3: You have to select full screen(monitor icon) or custom screen(area icon at the extreme right corner).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="screen recorder pro customize screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: Finally, click on Record button to start recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10"></a>Part 4. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with the video quality and certain features that Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 has to offer, you can opt for better alternatives. Here are the best alternatives to record screen on Windows 10.</p><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora is a professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has a built-in video editor. Therefore, you do not need separate applications for recording the screen and editing out video like a pro. Besides, the application is suitable for all types of recordings starting from application screen and webcam to videos games and web interfaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg"                      alt="wondershare screen recorder"                ></p><p>Most importantly, you can capture at 4K resolution and you can add voiceover if you want.

Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames"><a href="#Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?"></a><strong>Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?</strong></h2><p>OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.</p><ul><li>Your computer has an unstable internet connection.</li><li>Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.</li><li>Your video output resolution is very high.</li><li>Your video bitrate is very high.</li><li>Your internet upload speed is rather low.</li><li>antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Fix OBS Dropping Frame?</strong></h2><h2 id="Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator"><a href="#Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator"></a>Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator</h2><p>It is important to know that you are using the latest version of OBS. This helps to prevent encoding overload as well as problems due to stuttering. Make sure that you run OBS as an administrator. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install the latest version of OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and search for OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 3: Right-click on the OBS icon and select Run As Administrator option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-run-as-an-administrator.jpg"                      alt="obs run as an administrator"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution"></a>Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution</h2><p>When you reduce the resolution, the video quality gets lowered. But for smooth streaming and recording, you have no other option. When you reduce resolution, you require less CPU usage and less internet bandwidth. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will see Base and Output resolution.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce Output Resolution from the current or default setting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click Apply for saving the changes followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate"><a href="#Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate"></a>Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate</h2><p>OBS generally does not maintain a specified bitrate. It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority"><a href="#Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority"></a>Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority</h2><p>By changing the OBS process priority from Normal to Above Normal, there could be more processing power availability for OBS Studio. It helps in solving the problem of frame drop by driving performance from the system for better encoding and rendering. Here are the steps for changing OBS process priority.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Advanced tab and look for Process Priority.</p><p>Step 4: You will have to change it to ‘Above Normal’ from ‘Normal’.</p><p>Step 5: Click Apply followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-5-Update-Network-Driver"><a href="#Way-5-Update-Network-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Update Network Driver"></a>Way 5. Update Network Driver</h2><p>Dropped frame rates can happen due to the outdated network adapter driver. For this, it is important to look for the latest version of the driver. With up-to-date drivers, there will be a smooth connection when you are streaming or playing online games. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: From Start menu, search for Device Manager and open it.</p><p>Step 2: Find Network Adapters and click on it to expand.</p><p>Step 3: Find your LAN card and right-click on it.</p><p>Step 4: From the menu, select Update Driver option.</p><p>Follow the onscreen instruction to complete the process and restart your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/device-manager-update-network-driver-2.jpg"                      alt="device manager update network driver"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus"><a href="#Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus"></a>Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus</h2><p>There can be instances where firewalls can block the port for RTMP. It can interfere with the internet connection leading to dropping frames. Similarly, antivirus software messes with any third-party software and prevents regular operations. You have to temporarily turn off real-time protection as well as the antivirus software. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and search for Firewall.</p><p>Step 2: Open Firewall &amp; Network Protection.</p><p>Step 3: Turn off firewall for domain, private and public network temporarily to fix dropping frame issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-off-your-firewall-and--antivirus.jpg"                      alt="turn off your firewall and antivirus"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Virus &amp; Threat Protection.</p><p>Step 5: Under Virus &amp; Threat Protection section. Click on Manage Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-security-manage-settings.jpg"                      alt="window security manage settings"                ></p><p>Step 6: Turn on real-time Protection option as well as other available options as applicable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-security-real-time-protection.jpg"                      alt="windows security real time protection"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-OBS-Alternative-Tool"><a href="#Way-7-Use-OBS-Alternative-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Way 7.

A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won’t be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware. So without wasting any time, let’s get to our main topic.</p><h2 id="THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES"><a href="#THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES" class="headerlink" title="THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES"></a>THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES</h2><h3 id="1-Dirt-Rally-2-0"><a href="#1-Dirt-Rally-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.Dirt Rally 2.0"></a>1.Dirt Rally 2.0</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dirt-rally-poster.jpg"                      alt="dirt-rally-poster"                ></p><p>If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list. There has probably never been anything better. Despite its unbalanced package, this car offers outstanding handling and a driving experience as gripping as anything else in this class. The best way to experience it is with a good wheel, but it’s unbeatable for communicating the pure thrill of a car and the challenge of a course.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>In terms of career mode, both rallycross and rally mode is available.</li><li>You can play Freeplay to compete for titles, create your own custom game, and run-time trials across all tracks.</li><li>In addition to joining the team, players can increase the ability of team members.</li><li>Overall it offers a great gameplay experience which is worth all the effort.</li></ul><h3 id="2-iRacing"><a href="#2-iRacing" class="headerlink" title="2.iRacing"></a>2.iRacing</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iracing-poster.jpg"                      alt="iracing-poster"                ></p><p>The eSports industry is well known for three things: its costs, time commitment, and toughness. In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available.

Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.</p><p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2"><a href="#5-rFactor-2" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences.

If you want to edit a video, you’ll have to use some other software, and you’ll have to upload a video from your Stream account. Users that don’t want to edit their videos can proceed to upload the content to a group or a channel they are managing.</p><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Videos-in-Microsoft-Stream-3"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Videos-in-Microsoft-Stream-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Videos in Microsoft Stream?"></a>How to Upload Videos in Microsoft Stream?</h2><p>The process of uploading videos to this platform may be time-consuming if you are uploading more than just one video, but it is by no means difficult. However, the steps you’ll need to take to upload a video depending on where on the portal you want to upload your video. Here’s how you can upload videos to Microsoft Stream in just a few steps.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Selecting-the-videos-3"><a href="#Step-1-Selecting-the-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Selecting the videos"></a>Step 1 - Selecting the videos</h4><p>Head over to the Create menu, and click on the Upload a Video option.

Drag the files you want to upload to the designated area and drop them to start the upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-stream-upload-video-page.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Stream"                ></p><p>You can also search for videos you already uploaded or alter the search criteria. Wait for the videos to be uploaded and then proceed to add a title, metadata, or even subtitles.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Uploading-Videos-to-a-Group-or-a-Channel-3"><a href="#Step-3-Uploading-Videos-to-a-Group-or-a-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 - Uploading Videos to a Group or a Channel"></a>Step 3 - Uploading Videos to a Group or a Channel</h4><p>If you would like to add a video to a Group on the Microsoft Stream portal, simply open the group and drag and drop the file to the designated place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-stream-upload-video-channel.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Stream"                ></p><p>You can either upload a video from the group’s the Highlights or Videos tab, and the videos will become available in the group after the upload is complete.</p><p>Microsoft Stream users who want to add a new video to a channel, just have to navigate to the channel to which they wish to contribute and click on the Select More Files option.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Adding-Metadata-3"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-Metadata-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 - Adding Metadata"></a>Step 4 - Adding Metadata</h4><p>This step of the video uploading process is important because if done correctly, it increases the video’s chances to appear high in the search rankings.</p><p><strong>Descriptions and Titles</strong></p><p>Naming videos and adding a brief description that sums up what goes on in them will help other Stream’s users to find them faster. The title of your video can’t be longer than 300 characters, while the description must be shorter than 4000 characters. You can also use hashtags, insert links, or use time codes so the viewers to increase the interactivity of your videos.</p><p><strong>Video Language and Thumbnails</strong></p><p>A thumbnail is like a video’s profile picture, and the Microsoft Stream platform creates a few automatically, for each video you upload. You can select one of the thumbnails the platform has generated or you can upload an image from your hard-drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-stream-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Stream"                ></p><p>The video language option enables you to select the language spoken in the video. If the language of the video is supported by the portal, the closed caption file will be automatically created which improves the video’s performance in the search results.</p><p><strong>Privacy and Permissions</strong></p><p>The owner of the video can grant permission to other Stream’s users to view a video. In the Permissions section, you’ll be able to choose the groups or channels where the video will be displayed, or share the video with anyone in your company. Allowing other team members to edit a video, requires you to assign a new owner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-stream-video-privacy-permission.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Stream"                ></p><p>The platform allows you to keep your videos private and available only to users that have a password.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Captions-and-Subtitle-3"><a href="#Step-5-Captions-and-Subtitle-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5 - Captions and Subtitle"></a>Step 5 - Captions and Subtitle</h4><p>The Options tab enables you to add captions to a video or upload subtitles. The Video Language feature helps the platform generate captions for all videos automatically, and if you want to upload a subtitle or a caption you’ll need to make sure that they are in the WebVTT file format.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Sharing-and-Publishing-videos-3"><a href="#Step-6-Sharing-and-Publishing-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6 - Sharing and Publishing videos"></a>Step 6 - Sharing and Publishing videos</h4><p>Once you’ve edited the metadata, you can either click on the Publish Now or Share buttons. Clicking on the Publish Now option will start the upload process, and when the video is online it will be shared with everyone you selected.</p><p>The Share feature enables you to create a link, by sharing it on an enterprise social network such as Yammer. The link can then be used to share the video on all other social media. If you would like to make further adjustments to the video’s metadata, you can do so by selecting the My Videos option in the My Content menu, and clicking on the Edit option.</p><h2 id="How-to-Manage-Videos-in-Microsoft-Stream-3"><a href="#How-to-Manage-Videos-in-Microsoft-Stream-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Manage Videos in Microsoft Stream?"></a>How to Manage Videos in Microsoft Stream?</h2><p>All content you upload to Microsoft Stream will be displayed on My Videos page, and you can edit the metadata, filter, or browse through the videos as well as add videos to channels and groups. The portal enables you to sort out your videos based on different parameters such as view count or publish date, to name a few, which means that you can organize your video collection most functionally.</p><p>Editing metadata requires you to go to a group, channel, or My Videos page, click on the More button, and select the Edit option. You can then change the descriptions, hashtags, or any other metadata and improve the video’s search rankings on the platform.</p><p>Global administrators and group owners can change the settings of the groups they run. Name, descriptions, or the privacy status can be changed in all groups you manage, and the Delete option is also available if you want to erase a group. In order to do this, you only have to navigate to the group you’re managing and click on the Settings icon.</p><h3 id="Summary-3"><a href="#Summary-3" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>Microsoft Stream is still a young platform that facilitates corporate communications through videos. Its features include password protection and amazing sharing options that enable you to distribute a video to an entire company. However, the portal lacks some of the key tools that make communication within an organization easier. Stream’s users can’t capture webcam footage or broadcast live streams, but Microsoft has already announced that many upgrades are in store and that this business-oriented video sharing portal is going to continue to get better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The introduction of a hybrid console is truly a success that offers an extraordinary graphical quality while transitioning within the home console. Although this unique adaptability needs the compromise over functionality and power compared with the handhelds and dedicated consoles that have been introduced before. The games are played on the home part that is dock and console itself, over which we put the console in the dock to get the output image over the TV screen.</p><p>Moreover, it doesn’t require the installation of the software over the hard drive. It also includes the Micro SD slot at the switch backside, which provides additional storage capacity. But the main question is <strong>how to record switch gameplay</strong>?</p><p>There are basically three ways for <strong>Nintendo switch video capture</strong> gameplay.</p><p>This article will be in two part:</p><hr><p>Part I: Capture Your Switch Video</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"></a><a href="#part3"><strong>3. Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button"><a href="#1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button"></a>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</h3><p>The controllers come up with the built-in capture button. However, this button only allows the screenshot of the video which is not ideal in any case. But it records the video for 30 seconds as well. If this time is enough to capture your gameplay then do the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hold the controller in your hand.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the capture button on the left side of controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-console-pic.png"                      alt="switch-game-console"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold down this capture button marked with the square</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait until the message regarding capture completion is received at the screen top</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Your last 30 seconds of gameplay will be saved in the ‘Albums.’ It will record the 30 seconds gameplay right before you press the button down, so there is no need to worry about hitting it in advance. It is a quite simple step and allows only posting the clips to social media or saving them in your phone album. It also provides video editing before posting it on social media. You will be able to see the Nintendo Switch video capture in the Albums.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-interface.png"                      alt="switch-interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function"><a href="#2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function" class="headerlink" title="2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function"></a>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</h3><p>If you wish to save some important moves of your game in your album, then here is the second way. Some games have the option of replay saving at their bottoms, <a class="link"   href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/27540/~/how-to-capture-and-edit-gameplay-video" >complete list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> including:</p><ul><li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></li><li><em>ARMS</em></li><li><em>Splatoon 2</em></li></ul><p>Let’s take Smach Bros as an example. To do the recording, follow the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As soon as you have finished the game, the screen of the final score appears. A button appears at the top right down corner of the screen ‘Do you want to save the game’. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-interface.png"                      alt="smash-bro-ending"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the ‘Y’ button and then click on ‘Save.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-saving.png"                      alt="smash-bros-saving"                ></p><p>Tips: Make sure that you don’t press buttons other than ‘Y’ if you want to save the gameplay. The game replay will be lost if you do so.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video will be saved in the replays where you can check it. Go to the ‘Menu’ and then ‘Replays’, and the saved video will appear here (however, there is one limitation of such replays saved, that is they will be deleted as soon as the game is updated so make sure that you save the game replays in your album).</p><p>To convert the replays in the video, a straightforward option is given in the menu ‘Convert to Video.’ Go to the replay that you would like to save. Look at the right down corner and click on the ‘Convert to Video’ option.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-quality1.jpg"                      alt="video-quality-interface"                ></p><p>Tips: Within the video conversion settings, you can include information about the display, music, sound effects, and video quality of the replay. Check all these settings and select them the way you want your gameplay to be. Video quality is the most important thing to consider.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your gameplay will be converted to the video. In the videos section of the game menu, you will find all the videos that you have saved. Now power off your Switch and remove the SD card from your Switch. Connect the SD card with PC, it will appear in the folders shown below.</p><p> <strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-folder1.jpg"                      alt="saving-folder"                ></strong></p><h3 id="3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card"><a href="#3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="3.

One way is to edit the gaming montage is by editing it to the beat and the other is the speed control. Beat detection by beat marker is done by software automatically and adjusted with the video.

The games are played on the home part that is dock and console itself, over which we put the console in the dock to get the output image over the TV screen.</p><p>Moreover, it doesn’t require the installation of the software over the hard drive. It also includes the Micro SD slot at the switch backside, which provides additional storage capacity. But the main question is <strong>how to record switch gameplay</strong>?</p><p>There are basically three ways for <strong>Nintendo switch video capture</strong> gameplay.</p><p>This article will be in two part:</p><hr><p>Part I: Capture Your Switch Video</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>2.

Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button-1"><a href="#1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button"></a>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</h3><p>The controllers come up with the built-in capture button. However, this button only allows the screenshot of the video which is not ideal in any case. But it records the video for 30 seconds as well. If this time is enough to capture your gameplay then do the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hold the controller in your hand.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the capture button on the left side of controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-console-pic.png"                      alt="switch-game-console"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold down this capture button marked with the square</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait until the message regarding capture completion is received at the screen top</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Your last 30 seconds of gameplay will be saved in the ‘Albums.’ It will record the 30 seconds gameplay right before you press the button down, so there is no need to worry about hitting it in advance. It is a quite simple step and allows only posting the clips to social media or saving them in your phone album. It also provides video editing before posting it on social media. You will be able to see the Nintendo Switch video capture in the Albums.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-interface.png"                      alt="switch-interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function-1"><a href="#2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function"></a>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</h3><p>If you wish to save some important moves of your game in your album, then here is the second way. Some games have the option of replay saving at their bottoms, <a class="link"   href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/27540/~/how-to-capture-and-edit-gameplay-video" >complete list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> including:</p><ul><li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></li><li><em>ARMS</em></li><li><em>Splatoon 2</em></li></ul><p>Let’s take Smach Bros as an example. To do the recording, follow the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As soon as you have finished the game, the screen of the final score appears. A button appears at the top right down corner of the screen ‘Do you want to save the game’. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-interface.png"                      alt="smash-bro-ending"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the ‘Y’ button and then click on ‘Save.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-saving.png"                      alt="smash-bros-saving"                ></p><p>Tips: Make sure that you don’t press buttons other than ‘Y’ if you want to save the gameplay. The game replay will be lost if you do so.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video will be saved in the replays where you can check it. Go to the ‘Menu’ and then ‘Replays’, and the saved video will appear here (however, there is one limitation of such replays saved, that is they will be deleted as soon as the game is updated so make sure that you save the game replays in your album).</p><p>To convert the replays in the video, a straightforward option is given in the menu ‘Convert to Video.’ Go to the replay that you would like to save. Look at the right down corner and click on the ‘Convert to Video’ option.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-quality1.jpg"                      alt="video-quality-interface"                ></p><p>Tips: Within the video conversion settings, you can include information about the display, music, sound effects, and video quality of the replay. Check all these settings and select them the way you want your gameplay to be. Video quality is the most important thing to consider.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your gameplay will be converted to the video. In the videos section of the game menu, you will find all the videos that you have saved. Now power off your Switch and remove the SD card from your Switch. Connect the SD card with PC, it will appear in the folders shown below.</p><p> <strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-folder1.jpg"                      alt="saving-folder"                ></strong></p><h3 id="3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card-1"><a href="#3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Though it has proven to be an efficient and useful way of connecting with a team or with loved ones, maybe you’re sick and tired of enduring long hours of tasteless video calls and want to spice things up. One of the ways to do so is to use Snap Camera with Google Meet, in order to have access to the multitude of filters available on Snapchat. Let’s talk about how to do so.</p><p><em>If you’re using the Zoom app to have a video conference, you can also use Snap Camera on it. Check this article to find <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use Snap Camera on Zoom meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</em></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Download and Set up Snap Camera with Google Meet?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Use Snap Camera on Google Meet</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Snap Cam with Google Meet using Third-Party Inputs</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Add Filters to Google Meet Without Snap Camera on Mobile</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Adds Video Filters and AR Stickers on Google Meet</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Download-and-Set-up-Snap-Camera-with-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Download-and-Set-up-Snap-Camera-with-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Download and Set up Snap Camera with Google Meet?"></a>Part 1: How to Download and Set up Snap Camera with Google Meet?</h2><p>The first thing you’ll need to do is download and install the Snap Camera. It’s a very easy process. Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/" >Snap Camera website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click the Download button to start. Please note you’ll need a Windows 10 (64 bit) or newer; or a macOS 10.13 or newer to be able to download and install the Snap Camera.</p><p>Once downloaded, find the file on your desktop and double click to install. On the mac, you’ll need to drag the icon to the applications file (when you click the downloaded file it usually automatically shows you what to do).</p><p>Open the snap camera and you’ll be able to see your face on the screen. That’s it, you’ve downloaded the Snap Camera. Select the preferred filters and lens from the below list and check the result in the video stream window. Now onto the next step, which is configuring the Snap Camera to work with Google Meet.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Snap-Camera-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Snap-Camera-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Snap Camera on Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Use Snap Camera on Google Meet?</h2><p>There are two different ways of using the snap camera on Google Meet - the first method is to log in via Gmail and the second is to access Google Meet directly from the website.</p><p><strong>Method 1: Gmail login</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Gmail account and on the left-hand side of your Gmail landing page, you will see two options under Meet: New meeting and Join a meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-meet-options.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet  Options"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select “New Meeting” and then choose to send an invitation link or start right now. Here, let’s click on Start now and a Google Meet pop-up will tell you what the default video source is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-interface.jpg"                      alt="Google Meeting "                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the three dots on the preview screen and click on settings.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Inside the settings option, switch to the Video option and then you will see the first option that you get is “Camera”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-video-camera-settings.jpg"                      alt="Set Snap Camera as Google Meet Camera "                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on the options under the camera selection and select the Snap Camera.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Set the resolution to 720p or whatever the highest option is for the sending resolution and the receiving resolution accordingly.</p><p>That’s it! Now you’ll be able to use Snap Camera for your Google Meet communications! Let’s look at the other way of logging in to Google Meet: directly from the website.</p><p><strong>Method 2: Access Google Meet from the Website</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <a class="link"   href="https://meet.google.com/" >Google Meet website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you are logged in, you’ll be able to see the homepage which shows two options: New meeting, which allows you to create a new meeting , or join an existing one which says enter a code or link. So, to create a new meeting, click on “New meeting”, and then select Start an instant meeting to create. You can also create a meeting for later or schedule a meeting in Google Calendar. If you don’t see these two options, log in first, and then you’ll be able to access the two buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-website-options.jpg"                      alt=" Google Meet Website Options "                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To set up your Snap Camera and use it as a part of your Google Meet session, follow the steps below.</p><ul><li><em>Float your mouse over the bottom of the window to make the menu appear (find the microphone, hang up, and camera button), then click the three dotes positioned on the far right of the screen.</em></li><li><em>Inside the settings option, Select the Settings button from the</em> menu, <em>open the Video tab by clicking on Video.

Here is how:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Snap camera app and find the default camera input that it shows you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-third-party-camera-in-snap-camera.jpg"                      alt=" Google Meet Camera Source Settings "                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find the Gear icon on the top right of the screen and click on it to open the Snap Camera settings.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Inside the Snap Camera settings, you will be able to see the “Choose Your Camera” option, which should be the first option available. Just below, find the drop-down menu with all the available camera inputs.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select your desired camera input and change it to that. You’ll now be able to use ut with Snap Camera.</p><p>To use third-party inputs like Iruin webcam, Epic cam, or Canon Webcam Utility, you’ll need to select the Snap Cam as the input in the meet settings. Your input will be passed through Snap Cam via webcam utility or another application using your phone or your DSLR, then passed through to Google Meet. You’ll be able to use the filters with far better resolution on Google Meet.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Add-Filters-to-Google-Meet-Without-Snap-Camera-on-Mobile"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Add-Filters-to-Google-Meet-Without-Snap-Camera-on-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Add Filters to Google Meet Without Snap Camera on Mobile"></a>Part 4: How to Add Filters to Google Meet Without Snap Camera on Mobile</h2><p>Currently, Snap Camera is available for Windows and Mac computers, which means you can’t install it on your iPhone or Android phone. If you want to add filters to Google Meet on mobile, you can follow the steps below to use the on-platform integrated filters:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Google Meet on your <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings&hl=fr&gl=US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> device or <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/google-meet/id1013231476" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Follow the usual steps: start a meeting or join an existing one.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As soon as you access your meeting, tap on the “Effects” icon situated near the bottom of your face on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You’ll be able to access different options under the Effects icon, such as Blur, Backgrounds, Style. At the very end, you’ll find “Filters”.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the filters option and see all the filters available. Choose any filter you want, and it will be automatically added to your video input.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Google-Meet-Adds-Video-Filters-and-AR-Stickers-for-Personal-Call"><a href="#Part-5-Google-Meet-Adds-Video-Filters-and-AR-Stickers-for-Personal-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Google Meet Adds Video Filters and AR Stickers for Personal Call"></a>Part 5: Google Meet Adds Video Filters and AR Stickers for Personal Call</h2><p>Google Meet recently added new filters, effects, and AR (augmented reality) masks for calls on iOS and Android. On July 7th, Google tweeted that the new features would be available: “cats, astronauts, jellyfish and more”… Sounds exciting!
