While many suggest that you need to be a G Suite member to access Google Meet, you do not need to be a member to join a session. All you have to do is make sure you have an active Gmail account and then make your way over to the Google Meet website.</p><p>Once you have opened the website on your laptop or desktop, all you need to do is simply copy the meeting code or link that has been sent to you by the host of the session and paste it into the “Enter a code or link” text box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enter-code-link-to-join-in-google-meet.jpg"                      alt=" enter link to enter google meet"                ></p><p>After doing that, just click the “Join” button and you will be redirected to the joining page of the conference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-website.jpg"                      alt="join google meet on website"                ></p><p>From here, click on the “Join” button once again and the participant will join the meeting automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-join-now.jpg"                      alt="google meet join now"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-A-Google-Meet-trom-Gmail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-A-Google-Meet-trom-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Join A Google Meet trom Gmail?"></a>Part 2: How to Join A Google Meet trom Gmail?</h2><p>Just as a non-G Suite subscriber can <strong>join Google Meet with code</strong> or link through the Meet website. They can also join it through Gmail. Joining a Meet conference through Gmail is exceptionally easy. All you have to do is follow the steps outlined below.</p><p>First, go over to the Gmail website and log in to your Gmail account. Once you have done that, near the bottom left side of your screen you will see two options; “Start a meeting” and “Join a meeting”. To join a meeting through a conference link or code, click “Join a meeting”.</p><p>Upon clicking the “Join a meeting” button, a popup will appear on the screen asking for the meeting code. Here, enter in the meeting code provided to you and click “Join”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-on-gmail.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on Gmail"                ></p><p>The user will be redirected to the main joining screen of Google Meet, where they must click “Join” again to enter the conference.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Join-A-Scheduled-Google-Meet-From-a-Google-Calendar-Event" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?"></a>Part 3: How to Join A Scheduled Google Meet From a Google Calendar Event?</h2><p>Google makes use of very centralized processes, all its applications and functions are integrated. Therefore, you can even join a Google Meet Conference from Google Calendar. However, in this case, an event must be scheduled first by the host, and the participant who is looking to join must be a guest in the event. If you match this criterion then head on over to your Google Calendar to join Google Meet conferences.</p><p>Google Calendar automatically opens to the current day, so all your events from that day are visible on your screen, as shown in the image below.</p><p>From those events, click on the event which you would like to join and a popup will appear on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  on calendar"                ></p><p>On the pop-up, users can see a button saying “Join with Google Meet”, click that button and users will automatically be redirected to the main joining page of Google Meet.</p><p>Upon landing on the main joining page, click “Join” and you will become a part of the Meet session you wanted to join.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Join-Google-Meet-Using-Link" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?"></a>Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?</h2><p>Did someone invite you to a Google Meet session and send a link instead of the code? Well, you can still join the meeting with a link only as well. The process is very similar to that of joining with a Google Meet code.</p><h3 id="1-Directly-Joining-Through-URL-Bar"><a href="#1-Directly-Joining-Through-URL-Bar" class="headerlink" title="1. Directly Joining Through URL Bar"></a>1. Directly Joining Through URL Bar</h3><p>The quickest and easiest way to join with a link is by directly pasting it in the URL bar on your desktop or laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-in-google-meet-with-link-browser.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on browser"                ></p><p>Click enter and you will automatically be redirected to the Google Meet main joining page.</p><p>After being redirected to the joining page, you will have options to mute your microphone or turn off the camera, work with the options according to your needs.

Join A Meeting With A Link Through The Google Meet Website"></a>2. Join A Meeting With A Link Through The Google Meet Website</h3><p>Another way through which individuals can join Google Meet using a link is through the Google Meet website. First, you must open the Google Meet website.</p><p>After opening the website, find the text box which says “Enter a code or link”, paste the link over there and click “Join”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-with-link-website.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on website"                ></p><p>Once that is done, the participant will be redirected to the main joining page of Google Meet from where they can continue to the session.</p><h3 id="3-Join-A-Meeting-With-A-Link-Through-Google-Calendar"><a href="#3-Join-A-Meeting-With-A-Link-Through-Google-Calendar" class="headerlink" title="3. Join A Meeting With A Link Through Google Calendar"></a>3. Join A Meeting With A Link Through Google Calendar</h3><p>If the first two methods just aren’t working out for you, you can also join the session using the Google Calendar. Remember, to use this option, one must have a pre-scheduled meeting in place and they must be invited by the host. If that is the case then you are good to go!</p><p>Make your way over to the Google Calendar website and you will find all your events for a certain day displayed on your screen.</p><p>Click on the event which has been scheduled for the Google Meet session that you would like to join and a popup will appear on your screen like the one attached below.</p><p>On the popup you can see a button which says “Join with Google Meet” and just below that, you can find a link to the Meet session as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-link-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet  with link on calendar"                ></p><p>Copy the link from there and paste it into the URL bar.

After opening the application, click the “Join with a code” button displayed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-mobile-device.jpg"                      alt="join in google meet on mobile devices"                ></p><p>After clicking this button, Google Meet will ask for the meeting code.

To create Google Meet sessions, click the “New Meeting’’ option.</p><p>Upon clicking that button, three new options will appear:</p><ul><li>Get a meeting link to share - use this when you would like to create a meeting link and share it with other invitees and start the meeting after some time</li><li>Start an instant meeting - make use of this option if you would like to automatically join the meeting and then share the link with participants later on</li><li>Schedule in Google Calendar - use this option when you would like to create a meeting for the future.

The best way to schedule and create Google Meet links for the future is through Google Calendar.</p><p>One must first redirect themselves to the Google Calendar homepage and click the create option in the top left corner of their screen.</p><p>They must then select “Event” and proceed from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-calendar-google-meet-event.jpg"                      alt="Create  google meet on Google Calendar"                ></p><p>A pop-up form will appear on the screen which requires information regarding the conference.

Then move on to the date and time section and set the date to a time in the future for when you require the session to take place.</p><p>You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date. Follow the same process for the time as well.</p><p>Once you click save, the meeting will be confirmed and appear on your Google Calendar.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?</h2><p>There are numerous ways through which you can get the link to the session.</p><ul><li>Get a link from Google Calendar</li><li>Get a link from Google Meet</li></ul><p>If you are using Google Calendar to get the link, the process is fairly simple. Just go onto the Google Calendar homepage and if you have scheduled the event from before, click on the event you require a Google Meet link for. Upon Clicking on the event a popup will appear as shown below.</p><p>From the popup, click the “Copy Conference Info” button to get the link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-join-with-google-meet-link-calendar.jpg"                      alt="join  google meet on Google Calendar"                ></p><p>On a split side, one can also get their hands on the link through Google Meet itself. They can go to the homepage and they will see a list of scheduled events for that day over there.</p><p>From there just click the event you require a link for and you will be redirected to the meeting joining page.

Then why not just create a recurring link, also known as a permanent link. The process of creating a permanent link is the same as scheduling a Google Meet through Google Calendar, except one additional step has been added.</p><p>Before clicking save, click the “Repeat” option and select the days you would like the meeting to repeat itself. Then for all those days, the same link will be used.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-permanent-link.jpg"                      alt="create  google meet permanent link"                ></p><p><strong>Are You Ready To Start Creating Your Own Google Meet Conferences?</strong></p><p>Google Meet guarantees secure and easily accessible meetings to its users.

If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the “New Meeting” option.</p><p>Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-google-meet-invitation-link.jpg"                      alt=" google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Over here there are three options. By clicking the “copy link” button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.</p><p>If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the “Send Invite” button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg"                      alt="share google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Upon clicking the “Share Via Email” option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.</p><p>If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the “Start Now” option, and the meeting will automatically start.</p><h3 id="2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar-3"><a href="#2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar"></a>2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar</h3><p>Another way to create a Google Meet session is through the Google Calendar. Much like the process of creating it through Gmail, there are a few steps involved, but the process is very easy.</p><p>First individuals must go to the Google Calendar homepage and click the “Create” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-session-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="create google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>After clicking the create option, the screen will show two options; “ Event” and “Task”. Click the event option and a pop-up form will show up on the window which must be filled to create a Google Meet event.</p><p>Fill in the form, if you would like to invite participants to the Google Meet conference, you can also list down their email address in the “Add Guests” section. Once you have done that click the “Add Google Meet Video Conferencing” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-google-meet-video-conferencing-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>An event link will appear in the form, along with a button that says “Join With Google Meet”. Once you are done filling in the form, click “Save”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/join-google-meet-via-google-calendar-link.jpg"                      alt="join google meet  via  google calendar link"                ></p><p>If you are looking to join the conference instantly, click the “Join With Google Meet” option and you will be redirected to the conference. If you would like to join later, you can copy the joining link and search it on the Google search bar to be redirected to the conference.</p><h3 id="3-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Meet-3"><a href="#3-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Meet-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Meet"></a>3. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Meet</h3><p>Did you know you can directly create a conference through the Google Meet homepage as well? All you have to do is go to the Google Meet homepage and click the “New Meeting” button.</p><p>Upon clicking the button, you will see three options. From that click the “Start an Instant Meeting” option and you will be redirected to a new conference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-schedule-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Create schedule google meet"                ></p><p>These are the three highly recommended ways to create a Google Meet session instantly, but remember, to make use of any of these options, you must have a Gmail account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-on-Android-iPhone-iPad-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Google Meet on Android&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>Google Meet comes with an option for groups to create video conferences on their mobile and tablet devices as well. Whether you are using an Android device or iOS, you can easily create a meeting!</p><p>One thing to remember is that in order to create Google Meet sessions through a mobile or tablet device is that one must download the application of Google Meet.</p><p>Once the application has been downloaded into your device, open the Google Meet app to its homepage and two options will appear in front of you: “New Meeting ‘’ and “Join With a Code’’. To create Google Meet sessions, click the “New Meeting’’ option.</p><p>Upon clicking that button, three new options will appear:</p><ul><li>Get a meeting link to share - use this when you would like to create a meeting link and share it with other invitees and start the meeting after some time</li><li>Start an instant meeting - make use of this option if you would like to automatically join the meeting and then share the link with participants later on</li><li>Schedule in Google Calendar - use this option when you would like to create a meeting for the future. If you would like to know more about this, keep on reading as it will be covered later in this article.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-schedule-google-meet-iphone-android.jpg"                      alt="Create schedule google meet on iphone and android phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Schedule-and-Create-Google-Meet-Link-For-The-Future-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Schedule-and-Create-Google-Meet-Link-For-The-Future-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Schedule and Create Google Meet Link For The Future?"></a>Part 3: How to Schedule and Create Google Meet Link For The Future?</h2><p>There are times when individuals feel far more comfortable and organized knowing that they have pre-scheduled their meeting for the week. The best way to schedule and create Google Meet links for the future is through Google Calendar.</p><p>One must first redirect themselves to the Google Calendar homepage and click the create option in the top left corner of their screen.</p><p>They must then select “Event” and proceed from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-calendar-google-meet-event.jpg"                      alt="Create  google meet on Google Calendar"                ></p><p>A pop-up form will appear on the screen which requires information regarding the conference. If you are looking to create an event for the future, first give it a title in the title section. Then move on to the date and time section and set the date to a time in the future for when you require the session to take place.</p><p>You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date. Follow the same process for the time as well.</p><p>Once you click save, the meeting will be confirmed and appear on your Google Calendar.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?</h2><p>There are numerous ways through which you can get the link to the session.</p><ul><li>Get a link from Google Calendar</li><li>Get a link from Google Meet</li></ul><p>If you are using Google Calendar to get the link, the process is fairly simple. Just go onto the Google Calendar homepage and if you have scheduled the event from before, click on the event you require a Google Meet link for.

They can go to the homepage and they will see a list of scheduled events for that day over there.</p><p>From there just click the event you require a link for and you will be redirected to the meeting joining page. From there, just copy the link from the search bar and voila, you are good to go!</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-Permanent-Link-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Create-Google-Meet-Permanent-Link-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Create Google Meet Permanent Link"></a>Part 5: How to Create Google Meet Permanent Link</h2><p>Tired of creating the same meetings again and again?

Then for all those days, the same link will be used.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-permanent-link.jpg"                      alt="create  google meet permanent link"                ></p><p><strong>Are You Ready To Start Creating Your Own Google Meet Conferences?</strong></p><p>Google Meet guarantees secure and easily accessible meetings to its users.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Framerate-and-Quality-in-Game-Recorders-Explored"><a href="#Framerate-and-Quality-in-Game-Recorders-Explored" class="headerlink" title="Framerate and Quality in Game Recorders Explored"></a>Framerate and Quality in Game Recorders Explored</h2><p>If you like to record video games, Fraps can help you take your YouTube channel to new heights. Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Record Screen with Fraps"></a>2. How to Record Screen with Fraps</h2><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> When you first launch Fraps, you’ll see that there isn’t much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3. Pros and Cons"></a>3. Pros and Cons</h2><p>The number of frames per second (FPS) may be seen in the corner of the screen by users. After a picture is acquired, the platform automatically names and timestamps it. It also includes features for video files such as movie cursor hiding, stereoscopic 3D, and RGB capturing.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Fraps enable you to record high-quality DirectX or OpenGL games.</li><li>It enables you to see the number of frames per second (FPS) that you are receiving.</li><li>You may also snap a screenshot at any time interval using Fraps.</li><li>It enables you to record high-quality DirectX and OpenGL games.</li><li>It’s free to use for frame rate display and benchmarking, and it’s free to use for video capture with certain restrictions (30-second time limit).</li><li>It enables you to simultaneously record your games with computer sound and your voice.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Your computer screen, webcam, or face cam cannot be recorded.</li><li>The Microsoft Store does not enable you to record DirectX 12 or Windows games.</li><li>It is not possible to record the computer screen or webcam.</li><li>You can’t post a captured video to YouTube or Vimeo using it.</li><li>The Mac version of Fraps Screen Recorder is currently unavailable.</li></ul><h2 id="4-Best-Fraps-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Fraps-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Fraps Alternative"></a>4. Best Fraps Alternative</h2><p>One of its primary issues may have an impact on the game’s internal performance. When using Frap Screen Recorder to record, the quality of the recording degrades by roughly 13%. It may create lag and sluggish progress on their computer, and the reason for this may be due to the game’s high settings; thus, the game should be adjusted to the lowest level and played at a lower resolution. Fraps Screen Recorder does not fulfill your demands, which is one of the reasons you are seeking a solution. Yes, I see why. Fraps Screen Recorder is a unique screen recording application. Filmora Screen Recorder is another choice for Fraps Screen Recorder. This screen recorder program is quite flexible.</p><p>It can also capture the camera system’s sound and add speech to it using the microphone. It also has a separate game recorder with which you may record any game you choose. You may utilize your PC recorder to record your games by mirroring them to your computer.

How To Download and Use SplitCam?"></a>1. How To Download and Use SplitCam?</h2><p>SplitCam is available completely free of cost for Windows users. It is compatible with Windows 7 and Windows 10. Here are the steps you need to follow in order to download and record your screen with SplitCam.</p><p>Step 1: Visit “splitcamera.com” for SplitCam download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-visit-and-download.jpg"                      alt="splitcam visit and download"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install the application and launch SplitCam.</p><p>Step 3: Click on “+” icon to add a scene to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-add-a-scene-to-record.jpg"                      alt="splitcam add a scene to record"                ></p><p>Step 4: Thereafter, click on “+” icon under Media Layers to select the video source. If you want to record your screen, go to Share Display &gt; Share Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-share-screen.jpg"                      alt="splitcam share screen"                ></p><p>Step 5: Once you are ready, click on Record icon to start recording. The icon will turn red which means recording is going on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/splitcam-icon-turn-red.jpg"                      alt="splitcam icon turn red"                ></p><p>Step 6: To stop recording, click on the same Record icon. You can press Ctrl and click on Record icon to go to the location where the recording is saved.</p><h2 id="2-Key-Features-of-SplitCam"><a href="#2-Key-Features-of-SplitCam" class="headerlink" title="2. Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.</p><p>Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Alternative"></a>4. Best Alternative</h2><p>If you are looking for a better alternative to SplitCam after not being satisfied with its features and functionalities, we recommend you opt for Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is the best alternative to SplitCam as it covers all the shortcomings and provides all the features and options that users want. Starting from 4K video recording and professional editing option to multiple output file formats, everything is available to publish professional-quality videos. Here are the steps to record your screen and webcam with Filmora.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora for Windows or Mac.

Press F9 key to stop recording and the recording will be available for editing. After editing, click on Export button to save in desired file format.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>SplitCam as a free video record is great to say the least. However, it fails to produce the output as a professional-quality video recorder. You cannot record video in 4K resolution and SplitCam lacks editing options after recording. Besides, there are limited output file formats available. Hence, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to SplitCam.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora for Windows or Mac.
