It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy.

It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream.

It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><p>For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor.

The Streamlabs OBS helps you keep track of your donations and fans. With pre-made themes and templates, it is also easier to incorporate them in a live stream. Non-Streamlabs versions of OBS still support OBS templates, themes, and overlays. But due to its lacking of various features, there’s an alternative to it namely Wondershare Filmora. Both streaming and real-time recording are possible with Filmora screen recorder, which produces HD video quality and is easy to use.

You can use them on virtually every major streaming platform, from Twitch to YouTube to Facebook Gaming and everywhere else. You can create your streaming templates if you are a skilled designer and have access to appropriate graphics software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Fireworks.

The first step in setting up Wondershare Filmora is to download it from the company’s website and then run the setup file that is downloaded. Once it has been installed, you can run it from your computer. To begin recording, you must click the “Record Mode” menu after the software has been launched. As a result, a new screen will be displayed. In this section, you’ll need to select the area of your computer that you want to record. You can change the recording area’s size by dragging the dotted red color bar, or you can manually enter the screen’s dimensions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-mode.jpg"                      alt="record mode"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode-3"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode"></a>Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode</h2><p>A camera attached to your computer will automatically be detected and begin recording your activities as soon as you finish the installation. If you want to record part of the screen to use in your tutorial, you can do so in a variety of ways, including by selecting a specific area of the screen to record. Both webcam and screen captures are supported by Filmora. If you prefer, you can take advantage of an external camera. This feature is bolstered by the ability to select your preferred video recording resolution while you are filming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enter-the-recording-mode.jpg"                      alt="enter the recording mode"                ></p><p>It’s like when recording video, by default, the system’s audio is recorded, but this can be disabled. The built-in microphone can also be used, as well as an external microphone. For example, in gameplay videos, the audio-visuals of the game are just as important as the player’s reaction to the game. In addition, live streaming and online tutorials have become increasingly popular.</p><h2 id="Steps3-Set-Audio-Screen-Recording-Region-3"><a href="#Steps3-Set-Audio-Screen-Recording-Region-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps3: Set Audio&#x2F;Screen Recording Region"></a>Steps3: Set Audio&#x2F;Screen Recording Region</h2><p>You can now quickly and easily record audio for the video that was created with the screenshot using Wondershare Filmora (or the camera recording). An external microphone or the computer’s built-in recording system can be used for this.

This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time. The inactive time threshold can be configured by entering a value in the available box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unblocking</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Manage blocked users</strong> button next to the <strong>Blocked users</strong> label lets you view the list all the users you have blocked. The <strong>Unblock</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Blocked users</strong> box allows you to unblock the users for chatting.</p><ul><li><strong>Push Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The radio buttons under this section let you choose which type of chat messages can trigger push notifications so they are flashed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-notification-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Nofitications Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Other Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Keywords</strong> button next to the <strong>Receive notifications for</strong> label lets you define the keywords in the chat messages that can trigger notifications.</p><ul><li><strong>DND</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Do not disturb from</strong> checkbox allows you to define the duration of the day when Zoom won’t notify you about any chat messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Message Previews</strong></li></ul><p>When the <strong>Show message preview</strong> box is unchecked, Zoom prevents the text of the chat messages from appearing on the screen, and you must open the message to view its content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom"></a>Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom</h2><p>When it comes to texting there are several options available for you to choose <strong>how to chat in Zoom</strong>. For instance, you can send a message to everyone in the chat or send a private message to one of the participants, mention participant(s) while typing a message, and can even send a file to them if need be.

What File Types Does Zoom Chat Support?</h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> Restricting file types and configuring other options granularly can only be done if you have purchased a paid subscription plan.</p><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>Zoom chat</strong> supports almost all types of files. However, by signing in to your account on Zoom’s web portal, you can restrict them by their extensions. For example, you can configure your Zoom account to send only the files with JPG, ZIP, or RAR extensions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139121/17108" target="_top" id="2139121">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139121" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139121/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats"></a>Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats</h2><p>Zoom also allows you to save your text conversions for future references.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-retro-titles-best-pc-emulators-for-ps1-games-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Retro Titles Best PC Emulators for PS1 Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-soundwave-success-adding-audio-to-your-instastory/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Soundwave Success Adding Audio to Your InstaStory</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-inside-the-tech-a-comprehensive-review-of-apowersofts-recorder/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Inside the Tech A Comprehensive Review of Apowersoft’s Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-prime-imagery-for-virtual-sessions-tips-and-tricks/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Prime Imagery for Virtual Sessions Tips & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tomtoms-newest-bold-camera-the-bandit-2023/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, TomTom's Newest Bold Camera, The Bandit 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-quick-advice-preserving-gotomeetings-with-minimal-fuss/"><u>[Updated] Quick Advice Preserving GoToMeetings with Minimal Fuss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-smooth-transitions-the-ultimate-guide-for-audio-editors/"><u>[Updated] Smooth Transitions The Ultimate Guide for Audio Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-foundation-for-success-equipping-new-channels/"><u>[Updated] The Foundation for Success Equipping New Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-series-exceptional-5-slow-mo-tech/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Series Exceptional 5 Slow Mo Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/elevate-chromebooks-speech-profile-curated-list-of-top-web-tools-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Chromebook's Speech Profile Curated List of Top Web Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/exploring-online-collaboration-google-meet-for-2024/"><u>Exploring Online Collaboration Google Meet for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-beyond-capture-understanding-mycams-advanced-features/"><u>In 2024, Beyond Capture – Understanding MyCam's Advanced Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-exclusive-review-best-free-videocall-platforms-w-screen-view/"><u>In 2024, Exclusive Review Best Free Videocall Platforms W/ Screen View</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/transform-your-self-portraits-a-comprehve-insight-into-the-world-of-selfie-lights/"><u>Transform Your Self-Portraits: A Comprehve Insight Into the World of Selfie Lights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unlock-creative-potential-macs-top-free-drawing-tools-for-2024/"><u>Unlock Creative Potential Mac's Top Free Drawing Tools for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you have used Microsoft PowerPoint before, then you must know that in slideshow mode the slides appear in fullscreen making it difficult to switch between applications, therefore by converting the PowerPoint it will be windowed fullscreen, allowing the presenter to switch between applications. The process is simple, just click the “Slide Show” tab, then “Set Up Slide Show”, and from the drop-down menu press “Browsed by an Individual”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerpoint-browsed-by-individual.jpg"                      alt="set PowerPoint to individual browse"                ></p><ol><li>After setting up the PowerPoint slides, move over to Google Meet and join the meeting through the meeting link provided or schedule in a new meeting.

Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest. Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982462">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982462%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982462/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper.

If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975821/19272" target="_top" id="1975821">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975821" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975821/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings"></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111994/7443" target="_top" id="2111994">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111994" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111994/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3.

Both of them enable you to take screenshots using voice commands. If your Xbox One has the Kinect motion sensor, you should issue the ‘Xbox take a screenshot’ command. Viewing the screenshot immediately after it was taken, requires you to say ‘Xbox open that’ and the screenshot will pop up on the screen or you can just push and hold the Xbox button on the controller.</p><p>You can say ‘ Hey <em>Cortana, take a screenshot’</em> if your Xbox One features a Cortana motion sensor. However, in order to be able to issue voice commands, you must first activate this option. Head over to the Xbox One’s Settings menu and locate the All Settings option. Click on System and switch on the AI Companion feature.</p><p>It is important to say the command clearly so the AI can understand what you are trying to do, and for that reason, you should try to avoid capturing screenshots or recording videos via voice commands in noisy rooms.</p><h2 id="How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One"><a href="#How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One" class="headerlink" title="How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?"></a>How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?</h2><p>Capturing screenshots of the epic moments in an Xbox One video game and sharing those images with your friends is equally simple.
