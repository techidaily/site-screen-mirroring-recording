Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit.

However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island.

When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects.

Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need.

You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Alternative"></a>4. Best Alternative</h2><p>If you are looking for a better alternative to SplitCam after not being satisfied with its features and functionalities, we recommend you opt for Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Its features include password protection and amazing sharing options that enable you to distribute a video to an entire company. However, the portal lacks some of the key tools that make communication within an organization easier. Stream’s users can’t capture webcam footage or broadcast live streams, but Microsoft has already announced that many upgrades are in store and that this business-oriented video sharing portal is going to continue to get better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1061528/11832" target="_top" id="1061528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1061528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1061528/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-expert-analysis-how-showmore-enhances-your-video-capture-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Expert Analysis How ShowMore Enhances Your Video Capture Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-kid-friendly-quadcopters-top-5-selection-guide/"><u>[New] Kid-Friendly Quadcopters Top 5 Selection Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-ringtone-recommendations-for-your-chromium-phone/"><u>[New] Ringtone Recommendations for Your Chromium Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-unlock-the-full-potential-of-your-xbox-gameplay-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlock the Full Potential of Your Xbox Gameplay for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capturing-your-screenplay-free-software-insights-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capturing Your Screenplay Free Software Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-boost-your-youtube-output-rapid-video-rendering-and-transfer/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Boost Your YouTube Output -

Key Features of Ezvid</h2><p>Ezvid video maker is a great screen recording software and here are the features that the software has to offer to satisfy all the requirements of the video creators.</p><p><strong>Record Screen and Facecam</strong></p><p>Ezvid is an incredible screen recorder to capture your desktop screen as well as browser screen.

This makes the video more relatable and professional. Therefore, apart from recording the entire or part of the screen, you can record from the webcam and both the capturing is put together in the same video.</p><p><strong>Instant Screen Drawing</strong></p><p>Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder.
