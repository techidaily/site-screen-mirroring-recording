## Part 3: Slack Video Call Settings

Slack allows users to schedule a meeting with third-party apps or in Slack itself. You can just as easily have a Slack meeting using the in-built video call option.

You can either have a one-on-one video call in a DM chat or have a Slack meeting with 14 other participants through a channel video call. Either way, Slack has multiple video call settings to make your work and communication easier.

The settings tab in the video call enables you to create a name for the video call. There are also audio and video settings that can be changed to enhance the video call experience.
