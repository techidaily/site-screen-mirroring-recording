## A Compreenas Guide for Enhancing Your Facecam Recordings

Thousands of people on YouTube and other platforms create videos with their faces incorporated at the corner of the screen. Some may wonder how this is done. It just requires one to record the computer screen and a Facecam. Previously, people used to **record Facecam and gamplay separately** and then join them using other software. With the current growth in technology, you just need to record Facecam and computer screens at the same time and directly upload your Facecam videos to YouTube or your preferred platform.
