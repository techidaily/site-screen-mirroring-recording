3. **Telepresence** – Video conferencing tools that use telepresence to mimic human interaction as closely as possible. A digital presence, if you will.
4. **[Desktop Video Conferencing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** are the ones we are most familiar with. We all use our devices to connect to one single group video chat.

Fortunately, a modern laptop has all of these elements as standard.

 You will need a screen to watch others on, and you may want optional other equipment. A Video conferencing codec unit is used to convert audio and visual files into language the computer understands. Any other hardware and software is optional but can be used to optimize your experience.
