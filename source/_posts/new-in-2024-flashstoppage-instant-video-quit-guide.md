## FlashStoppage: Instant Video Quit Guide

QuickTime Player by Apple is the default media player on Mac, and the application comes pre-installed on Mac. Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they **cannot stop QuickTime screen recording** following the standard procedure.

## The Conclusion

QuickTime Player is the ideal application on Mac for playing audio and video. It is also quite capable of recording the screen comfortably. However, users often face issue of QuickTime stop screen recording. If you are facing the same, go for keyboard shortcut. If that does not work, you have to force stop QuickTime. If the issue is frequently occurring, you can consider Wondershare Filmora to replace QuickTime Player for screen recording. It is a professional screen recording and video editing software available for both Mac and Windows users.
