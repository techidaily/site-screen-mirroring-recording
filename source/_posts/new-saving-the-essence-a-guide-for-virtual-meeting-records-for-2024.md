## Part 2: How to Automatically Record Microsoft Teams Meetings?

Quite recently, Microsoft integrated a new feature to the Teams app that allows the organizers to automatically record all the meeting sessions that take place.

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare.
