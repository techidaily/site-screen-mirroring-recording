It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue. Here are the steps to follow to record Google Hangout with Mobizen screen recorder.

## Conclusion

The answer to the question "Can you record a Google hangout?" is yes. You can use the default Google Hangouts screen recording option if you have G Suite subscription. If not, you can use Wondershare Filmora not only to record Hangout sessions but also edit the recorded video like a pro. If you are an iPhone user, you can use the inbuilt screen recorder. For Android users, you have to install Mobizen screen recorder to get the job done.
