## Part 2\. Related FAQs of iPad Timelapse

**How long can iPad record time-lapse?**

Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad. These important factors can limit the recording duration of your time-lapse video. The longer the duration of the time-lapse, the lower will be the frame rate.

**How do you time a video on iPad?**

You cannot set a fixed time duration for capturing a video on iPad. You have to manually start and stop recording a video on iPad. However, you can always trim the video duration as per your requirements. You can use iMovie app to trim the video duration and time your video accordingly.

**Can you turn a regular video into a timelapse?**

Yes, you can turn a regular video into a timelapse video easily on iPhone and iPad. You can use iMovie app that comes pre-installed. Otherwise, you can install it from App Store. Besides, you can use any timelapse app such as Lapse-It and SpeedPro to turn your regular video into a timelapse video.

**How long is a 1 hour time lapse on iPhone?**

When the recording duration is one hour in timelapse mode, iPhone frame capture rate is 1 frame per second. This means a 1-hour time lapse on iPhone will be 4 minutes. The calculation is that you have to divide the recording duration in seconds by one frame capture duration in seconds. In this case, you need to divide 3600 seconds by 4 seconds. This comes to 240 seconds which is 4 minutes.
