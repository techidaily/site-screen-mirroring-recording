### Q2: Is it no longer possible to block individual contacts on Skype?

Skype enables you to block a contact to prevent them from sending you instant messages, calling you, and seeing your state on Skype, in effect blocking their access to your Skype profile. While the company also allows you to report the contact as abusive which can notify the company moderators to stop the spammers from an early stage and not allow them to torture other Skype users.

You can in effect block a contact in Skype

* 1\. Go to the “Recent Chats” or “Contacts” tab and select the contact you want to block.
* 2\. Right-click the contact name and chose the “View profile” option from the menu.
* 3\. In the profile of the contact, member scroll down to the bottom of the profile window and click the red colored “Block contact” option.

![block contact](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/block-contact4.jpg)

* 4\. Skype will ask you to confirm if you want to block this particular contact and also if you want to report the abuse from this person by pressing the toggle button.

![confirm block](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-block5.jpg)

* 5\. Press the “Block” button and the contact will effectively be blocked from your Skype account and removed from your contact list and chats.

Tips:

In case you receive an unwanted call from an unknown number, you have the privilege to block the number right ways from the chat. Just press the “Block + the number” link to block a particular number.

### Q3: How do I delete all contacts on a Skype list with one click?

Every once in a while, you may find some contacts you no longer need in your Skype contacts – particularly after a quick call or a job interview. Generally, to delete a contact you’ll have to view the person’s profile details and then press the “Remove from contact list” option, but here I’ll be showing you a fairly easy and simple way to delete all your contacts at once.

To delete all your Skype contacts at once follow the steps:

### Q2: Is it no longer possible to block individual contacts on Skype?

Skype enables you to block a contact to prevent them from sending you instant messages, calling you, and seeing your state on Skype, in effect blocking their access to your Skype profile.

## Part 4: Q&A about Skype Group Chat

Have some questions about skype group video chat? Keep the following!

### Q1: How many people can you have on a Skype group chat?

Skype group video chat enables up to 50 people to meet and cooperate all at once. The group screen sharing option allows the presenter to share PowerPoint slides, video recordings of the skype meeting, and much more. Making long-distance learning a possible reality for students all around the world and enabling remote co-workers to work on projects efficiently. Assign project modules and discuss due dates with more productive face-to-face conversations via Skype group video calling.

### Q2: Is it no longer possible to block individual contacts on Skype?

Skype enables you to block a contact to prevent them from sending you instant messages, calling you, and seeing your state on Skype, in effect blocking their access to your Skype profile. While the company also allows you to report the contact as abusive which can notify the company moderators to stop the spammers from an early stage and not allow them to torture other Skype users.

You can in effect block a contact in Skype

* 1\. Go to the “Recent Chats” or “Contacts” tab and select the contact you want to block.
* 2\. Right-click the contact name and chose the “View profile” option from the menu.
* 3\. In the profile of the contact, member scroll down to the bottom of the profile window and click the red colored “Block contact” option.

* 4\. Skype will ask you to confirm if you want to block this particular contact and also if you want to report the abuse from this person by pressing the toggle button.

![confirm block](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-block5.jpg)

* 5\. Press the “Block” button and the contact will effectively be blocked from your Skype account and removed from your contact list and chats.

Tips:

In case you receive an unwanted call from an unknown number, you have the privilege to block the number right ways from the chat. Just press the “Block + the number” link to block a particular number.

### Q3: How do I delete all contacts on a Skype list with one click?

Every once in a while, you may find some contacts you no longer need in your Skype contacts – particularly after a quick call or a job interview. Generally, to delete a contact you’ll have to view the person’s profile details and then press the “Remove from contact list” option, but here I’ll be showing you a fairly easy and simple way to delete all your contacts at once.

To delete all your Skype contacts at once follow the steps:

* 1\. Open Skype app and press the menu bar right next to your name. Select “Settings” to open the settings of Skype.
