## Digital Recording: TV From Desktop Devices

Now a days, itâ€™s pretty easy to transform your computer into a PC TV, and many homes used this method as a DVR alternative in the past. Connect the connection from the signal source to the external TV tuner, such as cable, satellite, or antenna service. A coaxial wire with a coupler on the end is the most typical connection. Turning the coupler clockwise around the threaded jack connects the cable to the tuner. However, the way we watch television is evolving, with most stations and sporting events now offering their applications through streaming applications and platforms. Some of them demand a membership, while others are completely free.

Plug the USB cable from the external TV tuner into any accessible USB port on the computer to connect it to the computer. In the information era, there is little time to sit in front of the TV and watch our favourite application. We urgently want the ability to record television applications and view them whenever we want. Because of its adaptability and mobility, a laptop is the finest device for recording television to a computer. Many PC users no longer use their PCs as DVRs due to the abundance of streaming tools accessible at any time, and the once-popular DVR apps have gone out of favor. A PC may record TV applications using the Windows Media Center application, which was included in various Windows versions. Despite this, Windows PC customers who wish to record shows on their laptops may use DVR options.

## Part 1\. How to Receive TV Signal on Computer

Recording TV shows will need some specialized hardware and software, but nothing prohibitive. Your PC will first need a TV tuner. If your computer does not come with one, you may purchase an external TV tuner that connects to your computer through USB or a TV tuner card that is placed inside. The next step is to connect a television signal to your computer. Discuss your exact choices for getting your TV signal to your computer with your TV signal provider for instance, cable or satellite company. You may require a set-top box from them, or you may be able to just plug a wire into your computer from your wall.

That concludes the hardware section. Now you'll need software that lets you view and record live television on your computer. There are many similar applications available, so look into them. Some operating systems, once again, will already have such a factory installed. If that's the case, start with that package. You don't need to purchase anything else if it meets your needs. There are third-party solutions with a variety of features if you like. Using your PC to record shows may remove the requirement for a digital video recorder. Newer computers, such as Windows Media Center, may come with video recording software, requiring just a TV tuner to obtain a signal that may be recorded. External TV tuners with simple USB connections are also available, eliminating the need to open the computer tower or laptop to install special cards.

Many have DVR-like features, such as the ability to pause live TV. Others may have even more features, such as the ability to create your own transcripts or the ability to search for a specific phrase to start the recording. Some will also allow you to connect the application to your actual television. You can now watch what you've recorded on your PC on your television. The point is that each application has its own set of options, so decide which are most important to you before choosing one. Keep in mind that these software options are quite resource intensive, so make sure your computer's hardware specs meet the software program's minimum requirements.

## Part 2\. Best Way to Record TV on PC/Mac
