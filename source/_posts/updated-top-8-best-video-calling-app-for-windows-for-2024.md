### 4\. [Zalo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/zalo-desktop/9nlspxn6g2jl?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

Zalo has almost the same attention to privacy as Wire, but it is marketed at a much younger age bracket.

Zalo is the best video calling app for PC that will let you call while you stream or game.

Zalo’s Main Features

Some of the Features that make Zalo a great video calling app for PC include:
