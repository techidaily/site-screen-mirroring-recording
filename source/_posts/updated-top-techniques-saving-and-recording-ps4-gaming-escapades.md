## Way 2\. How to Screen Record on PS4 via PC

In most cases, your gameplay is likely to go beyond an hour, and hence, PS4 inbuilt screen recorder may not be useful for you. If you want to record your gameplay for more than an hour, you have to use [screen recorder software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your computer. We recommend Wondershare Filmora to record your gameplay with your audio.
