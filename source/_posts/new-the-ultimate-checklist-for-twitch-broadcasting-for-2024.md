## The Ultimate Checklist for Twitch Broadcasting

Twitch is an extremely popular live video streaming platform, especially among gamers. Unless Twitch streamers enable Video on Demand, the live stream will not be accessible to the viewers later. However, it is quite possible that you cannot watch a live stream completely because you are occupied with other important works, and that is when you can record Twitch stream so that you can watch it later whenever you have time.

Even Twitch streamers may want to record their own live streams so that they can upload them on other video streaming and social media platforms. Apart from enabling VOD on Twitch by the streamers, you can record Twitch with a professional screen recorder. In this article, we have illustrated how to record Twitch streams on Windows PC and Mac easily.

## Way 1\. Save Video with VOD on Twitch

Twitch offers a special feature called Video on Demand(VOD) to all Twitch streamers. If a Twitch streamer enables VOD, his live stream will be saved for the streamer to watch it and upload it on his channel for his viewers to watch any time after the live stream gets over. Streamers can make highlights of the long live stream instantly and upload on social media and video streaming sties like YouTube. Here are the steps to save Twitch live streams by enabling VOD.

Step 1: Log into your Twitch account and go to Creator Dashboard. Click on the hamburger icon at the top-left corner and go to Settings.
