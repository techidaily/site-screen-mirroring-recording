## Part 2\. Related FAQs of Timelapse Recording

### 1\. How do you do a timelapse video on iPhone?

Following a few simple steps, you can easily timelapse a video on your iPhone; you only need to place your iPhone on a tripod, turn on the camera, and press the time-lapse icon. Point out the subject you want to timelapse on, and then hold and tap the area you want to focus on.

### 2\. Does time-lapse record sound?

Experts say that while shooting a time-lapse video, the device can't record the audio, and hence the audio doesn't get recorded; moreover, the effect is visible after the recording is completed.

You must use a third-party application to adjust the video's sound effects. Some of the latest applications also offer the audio feature, and you can browse the internet to learn more about them.
