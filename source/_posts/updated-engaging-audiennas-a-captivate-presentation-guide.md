Double-click on Adobe Captivate's desktop icon to launch the software, and then head over to Microsft PowerPoint and open the presentation you'd like to record in the second monitor.

After you click on the Create button, a new window will appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of the window, you'll be able to see Screen Area and Application options.
