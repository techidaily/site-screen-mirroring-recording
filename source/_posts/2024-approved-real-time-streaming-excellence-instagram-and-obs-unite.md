There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session. We recommend Streamon The application is also available for Windows, Mac and Linux users, just like OBS Studio. Before getting started, you should have the following ready.

* An Instagram account where you want to live stream from your computer.
* Live streaming gadgets such as webcam, external microphone, lights as per your requirements.
* Download and install Streamon as per your operating system.
* Download and install OBS Studio on your computer.

Here are the steps you have to take to setup OBS Instagram link to start live streaming.
