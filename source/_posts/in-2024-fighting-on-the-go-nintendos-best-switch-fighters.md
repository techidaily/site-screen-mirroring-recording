The fan response to Naruto titles has been varied, and yet this new three-pack delivers all three games to the Nintendo Switch with updated graphics and all of the downloadable content. In the end, you'll have a title that satisfies every fan of the franchise.

More so, the 3D style of gameplay develops in the series, which is quite refreshing in comparison to some of the 2D scroller games. A gripping story and a few unique combos make this a great game for those players who enjoy ongoing campaigns.

**Features:**

• Naruto Lovers will definitely enjoy this game

• Best gameplay

• Extra-Ordinary graphics make it worth playing

### 9.Kirby Fighters 2

While Kirby is likely to appear in Super Smash Bros, why is one enough when there are nearly two dozen? Kirby comes in all kinds of styles, including one called Wrestler and one named Bell. Their gameplay is all different.

A simple title like Kirby Fighters 2 can be enjoyed by families. As well as featuring iconic Nintendo locations and Meta Knight, the game features some other well-known characters from the Kirby franchise. Nintendo Switch is lucky to have this classic title, which really celebrates the company and genre.

**Features:**

• Best game to be played by families

• Although it may seem simple, the gameplay is intense

•A lot of characters to choose from

### 10.Arms

With this exclusive title from Nintendo, you'll get both a boxing game and a party game. This is an incredibly wacky game in every imaginable sense, with its colorful visuals giving a hint of the fun to be had.

Despite its chaos, it's relatively easy to participate. Fighting arenas in these games are characterized by their enormous boxing gloves and stretching arms, with players facing off in a wide variety of locations, yet somewhat uninspired. As for the balance, other games in the genre suffer from the same frustrations as this one does.

**Features:**

• Convenient controls and simple concept

• It plays easily with little effort

• Younger gamers will enjoy this game because it isn't violent
