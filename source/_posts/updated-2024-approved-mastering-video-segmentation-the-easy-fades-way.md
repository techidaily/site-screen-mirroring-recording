### 1\. Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage

The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.

So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.

Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* After importing video footage into Filmora, drag and drop them in the timeline.
* Go to the Transition tab and find Dissolve under the Basic category. If you didn’t see it, you can use the search bar to find it.

![Add Dissolve to Fade video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dissolve-transtion-filmora9.jpg)

* Drag the Dissolve transition to the beginning part of the clip, and then drag the Dissolve transition again to the end of the clip.

Besides applying Dissolve transition to fade video, you can also try the Fade or transitions under Ripple & Dissolve category such as Dispersion blur, evaporate, ripple, wind, swirl, or wave.

You can learn more about Dissolve transition at our guide [How to add Dissolve Transitions in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. Apply Fade Motion Effects to Video

Besides the regular dissolve and fade transitions, you can also apply motion fade effect to make your footage more vivid. Here is how to apply the motion fade effect to video in Filmora.

* Click the clip in the timeline and then switch to the Animation tab, scroll down and you will see the Preset Motions (Legacy) option in the Preset tab.

### 3\. Add Sample Colors at the beginning and end of the video clip

In case that you don’t want to hide any frames in your video, you can add a black screen or blue screen or whatever color screen at the beginning and end of the clip first, and then apply Dissolve or fade transitions or motion fade effect.

### 1\. Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage

The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.

So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.

Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.
