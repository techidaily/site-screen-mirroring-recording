Meta: Looking for a free software to record and edit audio on Mac? Audacity is a great choice. Learn how to record audio with Audacity on Mac.

Audacity is a popular choice among Mac users, especially among musicians who work with multi-track audio. In fact, even podcasters with limited budget prefer Audacity Mac for its advanced editing options.

That is why not just beginners but professionals prefer it over other premium audio recorders and editors. However, Audacity is slightly complicated to operate. In this article, we will illustrate how to use Audacity on Mac and recommend a better alternative.

## 1\. How to download and install Audacity on Mac?
