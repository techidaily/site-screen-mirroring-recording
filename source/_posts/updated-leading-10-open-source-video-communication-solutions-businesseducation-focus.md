4. **[Desktop Video Conferencing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** are the ones we are most familiar with. We all use our devices to connect to one single group video chat.

## Part 2: FAQs about Video Conferencing Tools

 Below, we have listed some of the most commonly asked questions regarding the use of video conferencing tools.

### Q) What are the different types of video conferencing?

1. A) There are five main types, although others may be derived from these. They are:
2. **Integrated Video Conferencing tools** – where the [camera and equipment](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are in the conference center. Like a lecture.
3. **Telepresence** – Video conferencing tools that use telepresence to mimic human interaction as closely as possible. A digital presence, if you will.
4. **[Desktop Video Conferencing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** are the ones we are most familiar with. We all use our devices to connect to one single group video chat.
5. **Room based Video conferencing frameworks using Codec** – a video conferencing tool that is best used when someone needs to communicate with a whole room while they are moving around.
6. **Service Based** – this type of online video conferencing tool is rarely free and requires your internet service provider to do the majority of the organization on your behalf.

 Hopefully, this clears things up for you!

### Q) What are the components of video conferencing?

1. A) There are a few basic things that you need if you want to start using any of the best video conferencing tools for business. You will need to ensure you have a working camera that can connect to your pc, or the internet. You will also need a [microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to ensure you can speak. A speaker so that you can hear answers is likewise essential. Fortunately, a modern laptop has all of these elements as standard.

 You will need a screen to watch others on, and you may want optional other equipment. A Video conferencing codec unit is used to convert audio and visual files into language the computer understands. Any other hardware and software is optional but can be used to optimize your experience.
