This is why Netflix has become everyone's favorite and we can't get enough of it. Netflix does, however, have certain limits.

When you go on a vacation and don't have access to Wi-Fi, you can have trouble viewing your subscription program when it airs. When it comes to screen recording Netflix, there's always the issue of whether or not it's legal. In most cases, the term "illegal" is used to denote a criminal law infringement.
