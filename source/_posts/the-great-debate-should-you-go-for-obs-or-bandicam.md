## Conclusion

To sum it up for you, OBS is completely free while Bandicam is a premium software. In terms of features, there is not much difference but Bandicam is significantly use to easy. Bandicam has more options for better screen recording but it lacks useful editing options. If you are looking for a better alternative Bandicam, we recommend Wondershare Filmora and you can record and edit video like a professional.
