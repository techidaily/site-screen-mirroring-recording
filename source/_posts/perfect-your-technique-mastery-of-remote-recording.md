## Part 4\. Hot FAQs About How to Record a Podcast Remotely

These are the frequently asked questions about remotely recording podcasts.

### What is the ideal duration for a podcast?

Your podcast's length will also vary depending on its topic, niche, or genre. The ideal size for your audience can be between 15 and 20 minutes. However, if your target audience wants more detailed, exploratory material, 45–90 minutes might be more beneficial.

### Can you create a podcast using only your phone?

Even older smartphones have most of the features required to generate a primary podcast. We've listed a collection of voice recording apps, audio editors, and software made especially for podcast production.

### What factors contribute to podcast success?

High-quality podcasts are more likely to succeed. Having high-quality audio can give your podcast a more professional appearance. Additionally, it will help you strengthen your entire business strategy and draw in pay-per-click advertisers. A wise long-term investment in the success of your podcast is high-quality recording equipment.

## Summary

Regardless of your platform, you might still want to utilize an audio editing application to polish and perfect your interviews. A crucial ability for a podcaster is to learn remote podcast recording. By informing your guests to utilize an external mic (USB mics are acceptable) and ensuring all noises and distractions are kept to a minimum, you can help screen your guests and get them ready for the interview.
