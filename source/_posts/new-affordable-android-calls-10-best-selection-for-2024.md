With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it.

**Conclusion**

Finding the alternative to FaceTime won’t take too long, as there are so many different video chat apps you can use to organize conference calls or group chats.
