## Part 5\. Online Webinar Recording

If you do not want to go for any webinar recording software free download on your computer, you can opt for an online screen recorder. This is useful for those who record webinar on the go or those who record once in a while. There are several online free screen recorders available but not all of them are safe and sound. We prefer Apowersoft free online recorder as it is a trusted recorder and it has all the required features completely. Here are the steps on how to record webinar online.
