## Shadow Scribes' Compendium: Best-Kept Voice Apps (iOS/Android)

In today’s world, you cannot prove anything to anyone unless you have concrete evidence.

The world has moved on from a secret voice recording device to a secret voice recording app. This is because we have our smartphones with us all the time. All you need is a voice recorder app to record any conversation without getting suspected.

However, a regular voice recorder app is not enough as any person around you could notice your phone screen and understand that you are recording.
