### Choosing Webcams for high-quality recordings

Most modern laptops are equipped with a built-in webcam, but the quality of these webcams depends on the laptop model you have. If you would like to make sure that your webcam videos are always captured in the best quality possible, then you should consider purchasing an external webcam.

The quality of the video you'll be able to create depends on the maximum resolution your webcam can produce. If video quality is really important to you, our advice is to acquire a webcam that can create a video in **1280X960P** **resolution** or higher.

**Frame rate** ensures that your videos will always look smooth and that's the reason why your webcam should produce **at least 25 frames per second**. Furthermore, the sound quality is as important as video quality, which is why you should make sure that your webcam has a built-in microphone capable of capturing clear high-quality sound or you should external microphone is necessary.

The **connection options** the webcam of your choice offers should play a part in your decision-making process, especially if you intend to create webcam videos from a desktop computer. Features such as **mounting options** or **auto zoom** should also be considered before purchasing a webcam.

Users in need of a high-quality webcam capable of remarkable performances should try using [Logitech 4K pro](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/4k-pro-webcam) webcam designed for video conferencing, video recording or streaming.

### Tips for recording high-quality webcam videos

#### 1. Choose the camera angle carefully

Unlike conventional videos, most webcam videos are recorded from a single camera position. You should place the camera at the straight angle since this type of camera position is frequently used in tutorials, software walkthroughs or gaming videos. However, if you choose a low-angle or a high-angle shot, make sure that the subject of the shot is placed at the very center of the frame.

#### 2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot

The importance of good lighting in a webcam video is often overlooked. Although using professional lighting equipment during a webcam video production may not be necessary, it is still important that a person or objects in the video are properly lit. You can combine atmospheric sources of light with artificial ones such as common lamps or LED spotlights.

#### 3.Use an [external microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Most webcams of the latest generation have a built-in microphone, but if you would like to be sure that your voiceover is impeccable, we suggest using an external shotgun microphone. This type of microphone rejects atmospheric noises from 30 degrees on both sides, while perfectly capturing the sounds coming directly from the front.

## Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video

Despite being one of the best screen and webcam recorders on the market, the video editing options Filmora Scrn offers still lack the depth of more advanced video editing software products. Wondershare's [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor is a much better option than Filmora Scrn if you would like to edit your videos professionally before posting them online.

### Tips for recording high-quality webcam videos

#### 1. Choose the camera angle carefully

Unlike conventional videos, most webcam videos are recorded from a single camera position. You should place the camera at the straight angle since this type of camera position is frequently used in tutorials, software walkthroughs or gaming videos. However, if you choose a low-angle or a high-angle shot, make sure that the subject of the shot is placed at the very center of the frame.

#### 2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot

The importance of good lighting in a webcam video is often overlooked. Although using professional lighting equipment during a webcam video production may not be necessary, it is still important that a person or objects in the video are properly lit. You can combine atmospheric sources of light with artificial ones such as common lamps or LED spotlights.

#### 3.Use an [external microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Most webcams of the latest generation have a built-in microphone, but if you would like to be sure that your voiceover is impeccable, we suggest using an external shotgun microphone. This type of microphone rejects atmospheric noises from 30 degrees on both sides, while perfectly capturing the sounds coming directly from the front.
