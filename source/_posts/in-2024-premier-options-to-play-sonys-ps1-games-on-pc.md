## Premier Options to Play Sony's PS1 Games on PC

Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001\. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo's SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.

Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.

### 3.Mednafen

![mednafen-poster-ps1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png)

Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.

The majority of Mednafen's cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.

**Features:**

* Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.
* Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.
