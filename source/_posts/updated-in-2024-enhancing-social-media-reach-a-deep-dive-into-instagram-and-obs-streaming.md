## Enhancing Social Media Reach: A Deep Dive Into Instagram & OBS Streaming

Instagram is steadily becoming a great video content platform against the popular belief that it is merely a photo posting platform. In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.

Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones. However, just like YouTube, you can live stream from your computer if the popular Instagrammers are doing these days. You need OBS Studio which is available for free and it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux. In this article, we will illustrate how to use OBS to Instagram live in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Setup OBS Studio

OBS Studio is a live video stream software platform for computer users. You can live stream on almost any video streaming platform as long as you have the stream URL and stream key. On the other hand, Instagram only allows Instagram Live feature from its app. Therefore, you need a third-party app to obtain the stream URL and stream key so that you can connect OBS Studio with Instagram for live stream.

There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session. We recommend Streamon The application is also available for Windows, Mac and Linux users, just like OBS Studio. Before getting started, you should have the following ready.

* An Instagram account where you want to live stream from your computer.
* Live streaming gadgets such as webcam, external microphone, lights as per your requirements.
* Download and install Streamon as per your operating system.
