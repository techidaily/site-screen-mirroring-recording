OBS Studio is a live video stream software platform for computer users. You can live stream on almost any video streaming platform as long as you have the stream URL and stream key.

There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session. We recommend Streamon The application is also available for Windows, Mac and Linux users, just like OBS Studio. Before getting started, you should have the following ready.

* An Instagram account where you want to live stream from your computer.
* Live streaming gadgets such as webcam, external microphone, lights as per your requirements.
* Download and install Streamon as per your operating system.
