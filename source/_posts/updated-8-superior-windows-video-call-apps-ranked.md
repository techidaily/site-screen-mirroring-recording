### 3\. [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

The online platform Wire is one of the best video calling apps for pcs. It takes a different approach from our list's other video calling apps. Rather than focusing on call quality and signal strength, they focus more intensely on the security side of things. The wire is, in effect, the best video calling app for pcs with Windows 10 if you want to be sure nobody can trace or watch your calls.

Wire’s Main Features

Some of the features that make Wire such a fantastic video calling app for pc (Windows 10) are:

* End-to-end encryption makes it a secure way to send videos without being traced.
* Group calls for up to 10 participants, video chatting at once!
* Very adaptive to network conditions – will run even on the poorest connection.

### 4\. [Zalo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/zalo-desktop/9nlspxn6g2jl?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

Zalo has almost the same attention to privacy as Wire, but it is marketed at a much younger age bracket. This is probably your friends' messaging service if you have all the latest social media apps on your phone. Zalo is the best video calling app for PC that will let you call while you stream or game.

Zalo’s Main Features

Some of the Features that make Zalo a great video calling app for PC include:

* A full range of emotions, including some you didn’t know existed.

### 5\. [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype. It has tons of great features but grew to success in the days when calling was still expensive and video calling was almost unheard of. Skype made waves in the market by being one of the first services to do it all for free.

Skype’s Main Features

Some of the things that earned Skype a place on our list of the best video chat apps for your PC include:

* Skype credit allows you to call mobile phones from your PC.
* Skype Number is their version of the online phone book.
* Call forwarding, voicemail, and Skype Go (which lets you call from mobiles).

![Skype](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype.JPG)

### 6\. [Google Duo](https://duo.google.com/about/)

Another of the best video calling apps for pc is the Google Duo app. This is Google’s answer to Skype. It is designed to work across different devices so that you can communicate with friends, even if they are on a Smartphone or a tablet. It is fully compatible with all Google products, which is why it consistently ranks highly in reviews.

Google Duo’s Main Features

Some of the main features of Google Duo include:

* Very high-quality video calling.
* Can group chat with up to 8 other people at once.
* You can get live previews of who calls before you agree to answer, like an internet caller ID.

### 7\. [ICQ](https://icq.com/windows/en)

Just as Google has its instant messaging version, so too does Windows. ICQ is arguably the best video calling app for PC (Windows 10) because it has been designed to work in harmony with this and not much else. They have a Linux and a Mac version, but it was made for PC users. It’s simple but effective.

ICQ’s Main Features

Some of the things that make ICQ one of the best video calling apps for PCs are:

* It’s clean, simple, and easy to use.
* Offline user messaging, as well as SMS limited sending.
* Greeting cards, video games, and more.
