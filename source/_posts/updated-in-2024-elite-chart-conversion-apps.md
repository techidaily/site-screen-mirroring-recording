 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Three decades after Microsoft PowerPoint was initially released in May 1990, this presentation software has become a symbol of professionalism and excellence. However, there are quite a few downsides to traditional PPT files, PowerPoint produces because the contents of your presentations can be easily modified and used by someone else.

The 2010 and later versions of PowerPoint have addressed this issue by including the Save to Video option that enabled users to create video files which can be easily posted on social media, video sharing platforms or used in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion option featured in recent versions of PowerPoint has certain limitations that prevent you from choosing the video file format or including inserted media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's the reason why we've gathered 10 best PPT to video converters that make the process of producing a video from a PowerPoint presentation easy and fun.

## Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software

Investing your money wisely is always a good idea because the most expensive solution is often not the best solution. The same is true for PPT to Video converter software, so before you go ahead and choose the program you will be using to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos here are a few tips that will help you make up your mind.

Checking the amount of video file formats supported by the software is the key step towards selecting the right converter because it will give you the versatility the PowerPoint's built-in PPT to video converter lacks. What's more, some of the programs for PPT to video file conversions don't allow you to convert audio files or animations into videos, which can ruin the original presentation, so prior to buying a software make sure that it can turn multimedia files into videos as well.

Last, but certainly not the least, try to determine whether or not the software is cost-effective because there is absolutely no point in spending a lot of money on a software that has the same PPT to video file conversion capabilities as PowerPoint.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Three decades after Microsoft PowerPoint was initially released in May 1990, this presentation software has become a symbol of professionalism and excellence. However, there are quite a few downsides to traditional PPT files, PowerPoint produces because the contents of your presentations can be easily modified and used by someone else.

The 2010 and later versions of PowerPoint have addressed this issue by including the Save to Video option that enabled users to create video files which can be easily posted on social media, video sharing platforms or used in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion option featured in recent versions of PowerPoint has certain limitations that prevent you from choosing the video file format or including inserted media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's the reason why we've gathered 10 best PPT to video converters that make the process of producing a video from a PowerPoint presentation easy and fun.

## Tips for Choosing PPT to Video Converter Software

Investing your money wisely is always a good idea because the most expensive solution is often not the best solution. The same is true for PPT to Video converter software, so before you go ahead and choose the program you will be using to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos here are a few tips that will help you make up your mind.

Checking the amount of video file formats supported by the software is the key step towards selecting the right converter because it will give you the versatility the PowerPoint's built-in PPT to video converter lacks. What's more, some of the programs for PPT to video file conversions don't allow you to convert audio files or animations into videos, which can ruin the original presentation, so prior to buying a software make sure that it can turn multimedia files into videos as well.

Last, but certainly not the least, try to determine whether or not the software is cost-effective because there is absolutely no point in spending a lot of money on a software that has the same PPT to video file conversion capabilities as PowerPoint.

If you are looking for a reliable tool that lets you convert PowerPoint presentations into videos, then this converter is the right choice for you. Movavi PPT to Video Converter lets you optimize your videos for viewing on mobile devices which makes it particularly useful if you want to extend the reach of your videos.

You can convert all PowerPoint files created with the 2013 or older versions of the software, and save them in AVI, MOV, MP4 video file formats as well as HTML5 formats such as WebM or OGV. Adding narration or background music to the videos you convert is also on the list of options Movavi PPT to Video Converter provides so you can easily create tutorials or any other type of educational videos.

**Pros:**

* Affordable
* Enables you to embed PowerPoint presentations on blogs and websites

**Cons:**

* You can convert only one presentation at the time
* Not perfectly suited for professional use

#### 7. Shine PPT to Video Converter

**Price:** $49.95

**Compatibility** **:** WindowsXP or later

![PPT to Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shine-ppt-video-converter.jpg)

This software provides a quick way to convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos, but it fails to offer much else. Shine PPT to Video Converter lets you save your videos in AVI, MPEG, FLV, MP4 or MOV file formats, but it doesn't allow you to produce HD videos. Furthermore, its audio support is underwhelming, since adding voiceovers or creating soundtracks isn't something you can do with this PPT to Video file converter.

The free version of the software is only available for a limited period of time, which makes it a poor option if you need to convert PowerPresentations into videos on a constant basis. Processing multiple PowerPoint presentations at the same time is not possible with Shine PPT to Video Converter.

**Pros:**

* Easy to use
* Supports all popular video file formats

**Cons:**

* Not cost-effective
* Terrible file sharing capabilities

#### 8. Xilisoft

**Price:** Free version available, Plans start at $41.97

![PPT to Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-convert-ppt-video.jpg)

This simple and free online tool enables you to convert audio, video or image files as well as documents. The process of converting a PowerPoint presentation using the Online-Convert platform is straightforward since you only have to select the Video Converter option from the menu and upload the file you want to convert.

Even though the Online-Convert platform lets you adjust the basic video settings, like frame rates, audio quality or the size of the screen it lacks more advanced PPT file conversion options.

**Pros:**

* Free and easy to use
* Can be used to convert other types of documents and multimedia files.

* No file sharing options
* Limited video output formats
