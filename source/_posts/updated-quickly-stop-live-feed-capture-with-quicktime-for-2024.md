## Quickly Stop Live Feed Capture with QuickTime

QuickTime Player by Apple is the default media player on Mac, and the application comes pre-installed on Mac. Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they **cannot stop QuickTime screen recording** following the standard procedure.

When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording. We will also recommend a better alternative to QuickTime for professional-quality screen recording.
