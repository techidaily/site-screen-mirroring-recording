[Video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow us to keep in touch with our friends and family during these difficult times without jeopardizing anyone’s safety. Mac, iPhone, or iPad users don’t have to think much about which video chat app they are going to choose as FaceTime is both free and easy to use.

Android operating systems don’t come with FaceTime’s equivalent, which is the reason why their users have to find a video chat app that best suits their needs. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best free FaceTime for Android alternatives.

The best part is that you don’t have to spend a single cent to be able to communicate with a friend who has an iPhone from your Android device. Here are the ten best free video chat alternatives to FaceTime on Android.

![ FaceTime Alternative: Skype for iPhone  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-for-iphone-talk-chat-collaborate.jpg)

At the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, the number of Skype’s users increased by 70% in a single month. This statistic alone speaks volumes about the app’s popularity, as millions of people choose to talk to their business associates or friends through Skype.

Besides being one of the most popular [cross-platform video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created, Skype is also remarkably easy to use, as you just need a webcam and a microphone to start a video call.

![ FaceTime Alternative: Snapchat  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-video-chat.jpg)

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

### Facetime for Android Alternatives FAQs

#### Can an Android Chat with an iPhone?

Yes, of course, although you can’t use FaceTime, because the app is not compatible with the Android operating system. Installing any of the apps we featured in this article will enable you to communicate with iPhone owners for free, although they will also have the app through which you want to reach them installed on their smartphones.

**Conclusion**

Finding the alternative to FaceTime won’t take too long, as there are so many different video chat apps you can use to organize conference calls or group chats. Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Google Duo are some of the most obvious choices, even though millions of people are using apps like WhatsApp, Viber, or WeChat to video chat with their friends and family.
