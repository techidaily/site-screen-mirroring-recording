**Step 5**: Now tap audio or video to start a call.

### Can you Facetime with Android?

 No, unfortunately, Facetime is not compatible with Android devices or any other device apart from Apple as of that matter. It only suits the Apple ecosystem.

### What is the Android equivalent of Facetime

 There are apps that offer similar features like that in Facetime. However, Google Duo seems to be the best out of all. The fantastic video quality and other features make it almost as perfect as Facetime for Android users.
