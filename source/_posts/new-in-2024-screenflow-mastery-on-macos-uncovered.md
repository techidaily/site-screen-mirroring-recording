Step 2.Media & Screen Recording:

You'll be provided with a dialog box for capture settings such as source and audio choices when you select to start a new screen recording.

### iMovie

Consider utilizing an iMovie player if you don't have any advanced screen recording or editing requirements. It's free and comes standard with Mac OS, but you won't have access to sophisticated editing, annotations, or filters. iMovie is ideal for quickly capturing your screen or producing recordings that need no (or little) editing. Simply launch iMovie and choose File > New Screen Recording from the File menu. In addition, when your film is ready for a big release, you may see it in iMovie Theater on all of your devices. Explore your video collection, share your favorite moments, and create high-quality movies with resolutions up to 4K. You can even start altering videos on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

Both iMovie for Mac and iMovie for iOS are designed to work together. All of your produced films and trailers appear as a gorgeous exhibition of motion picture notices in iMovie Theater. With a simple interface and intuitive editing features, the iMovie app allows you to get the most out of your recordings and tell tales like never before. You may rotate, divide, and cut your movies, and you can add clips after a recording if you wish to combine the screen recording with another reference. Only MOV files may be exported; otherwise, you'll need to use a video converter.

Features:

* Streaming audio and video may be recorded.
* Simultaneously record screen and webcam footage.
* Make changes to the capture area.
* Easy mode allows you to quickly build a montage.
* Picture-in-picture and slow-motion are among the special effects offered.
* Divide the movie into sections and use seamless transitions between them.
* Enhance your videos using screenshots and video snippets.

### Final Cut Pro

For Mac users, Final Cut Pro is the most direct rival of ScreenFlow. For the last two years, we've been utilizing Final Cut Pro for Mac. Final Cut Pro has a very low learning curve: it's really simple to use. It also has a simple ScreenFlow solution that enables you to swiftly move material from phones and tablets to the software. If you want to make movies on the web and share them with friends or family, Final Cut Pro is another easy-to-use and easy-to-learn video editor for casual users. It's possibly the most affordable commercial video editor available. One thing we don't like about the application is that it lacks screen recording capabilities, which many of its rivals possess.

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg)

Final Cut Pro is an excellent piece of software for producing high-quality films, television programs, and advertisements. You may pick from a variety of video effects, titling choices, and movie templates in the software. It also has 4K and motion tracking capabilities. It isn't the most user-friendly video editor, though, since it lacks import and organizing options. Final Cut Pro is aimed towards all PC users, the same as ScreenFlow is. Final Cut Pro14, the most recent version, fits clearly in the upper echelon of video editors. Many amateurs may be put off by the price, but if you want to make professional-looking movies for commercial usage, you get what you paid for.

Features:

* Make a video instruction or record gameplay.
* Add lines, numbers, and text to your recording as you go.
* Add a watermark, edit, or trim your video to make it seem better.
* Trim the video's beginning and finish.
* Record the whole screen or a rectangular region; the area immediately around the mouse; or drag and modify to get the precise image you want.
* External devices, such as a smartphone or a camera, may be recorded.

## Conclusion

When it comes to the finest screen recording software, ScreenFlow is a must-have. ScreenFlow is a Mac-only tool that is one of the most well-known screen recording programs. That is to say, ScreenFlow is just for Mac users. Recording a computer screen is a typical occurrence for us. We can use screen recording to create video lessons, preserve online courses, record live streaming videos, capture video conversations, and so on to a local disc for later viewing. If you're looking for a dependable tool to record your screen, this article has you covered, with a list of the finest ScreenFlow alternatives to select from. We like Filmora because of its sleek and extravagant appeal.
