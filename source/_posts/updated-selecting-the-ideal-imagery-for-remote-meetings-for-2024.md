## Part 3: How to Add A Virtual Background for Google Meet?

Adding a virtual background on Google Meet is a fairly simple task. Here’s how!

Important: Note that if you are entering the meeting without logging into your Google account, and if you require a knock to get admitted into the meeting, you will not be able to use this feature. Also, users who join Google Workspace for educational meetings, can not select their virtual backgrounds for Google Meet.

First, open the Google Meet session and enter into the meeting. At the bottom of your window click on the 3-dots option and click the “Apply visual effects” option from there.

![Google Meet change  background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-visual-effects-option-google-meet.jpg)

To [blur your backgrounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) slightly or completely, you can click the blur buttons accordingly. If you want to opt for the built-in backgrounds, click on any of the backgrounds offered by Google Meet that you like the best.

However, if you want to add your own virtual background from your device then click “Add”.
