## United Experts: EaseUS Expert Reviews

EaseUS RecExperts is a screen recording program for Windows that allows users to capture a complete screen or a select area of it, as well as record narrator voice or system noises and improve the overall quality of the individual clip. Within a PC, the system may be utilized to create professional-looking films. Camera video recording is supported by EaseUS RecExperts, allowing users to shoot movies inside the webcam or as an overlay, allowing for higher levels of involvement. You may record the whole screen, a specific region, or even a locked window with EaseUS RecExperts. Additionally, while recording, you may annotate your screen, label an area, and do other editing activities. You can rapidly export or distribute your recording to various platforms, depending on your preferences.

EaseUS RecExperts is a multi-purpose but simple-to-use Windows screen recorder that allows you to record and capture everything on your computer's screen. Thanks to its simple and well-organized interface, you can get started quickly. You may record your screen, audio, and camera independently or all at once. In addition, the game recording option enables you to record your games in whatever way you desire. Annotation, cutting, watermark insertion, and other sophisticated editing tools are included in the program. The recordings may be exported in a variety of file formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV. They may even upload the created video to YouTube immediately. Noise reduction and audio enhancement are also included in the software's capabilities. It comes with its game recording mode, capable of capturing popular 2D/3D games in 4K UHD quality. Users may use the built-in task planner to complete their recording tasks on time and in an automatic manner.

## 1\. Price and Tech Specifications

EaseUS RecExperts cost $11.97 a month, $23.97 a year, or $69.95 for the rest of your life. A single license for one machine is included in this price. It's worth noting that you can test out the program for free. The trial version restricts you to two-minute recordings and adds a watermark to your movies.

Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Mac OS are all supported by EaseUS RecExperts. Initially, EaseUS Screen Recorder was only available for Windows, but a Mac OS version was eventually published. The program will be installed as a standalone app on your system disk. There are no further add-ons required. When recording games, RecExperts also allows you to alter the frame rate up to 60 frames per second. RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.

## 2\. How to Use RecExperts

EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It's a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.

Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts

As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software's key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.

Step 2: Setup the Recording

For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange "REC" button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:

![setup the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg)

Step 3: Finish/Save Recording

We may finish the recording by clicking the red "stop" button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:

The bulk of screen recording software comes with basic features such as capture, editing, and live documentation. However, a good software must-have features like zone selection, sound blender, webcam capture, recording clock, social fare, and incredible video altering devices like change video speed, change the boundary, and much more advanced features that RecExperts screen recorder lags, which is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora to help with all of RecExperts screen recorder's flaws.

## Conclusion

For Windows and Mac OS users, EaseUS RecExperts is a basic and easy-to-use screen recording application. The tool has a lot of functions and is reasonably priced. The bulk of screen recording software comes with basic features such as capture, editing, and live documentation. However, a good software must-have features like zone selection, sound blender, webcam capture, recording clock, social fare, and incredible video altering devices like change video speed, change the boundary, and much more advanced features that RecExperts screen recorder lags, which is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora to help with all of RecExperts screen recorder's flaws.
