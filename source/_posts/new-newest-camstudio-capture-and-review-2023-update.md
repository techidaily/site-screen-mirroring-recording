Video Recording – You can record your screen as well as webcam video individually as well as simultaneously.

Add Components – There is an option for adding annotations if you need it. Besides, you can attach a fixed watermark or text to the recorded video. Moreover, you can add a timestamp on the video if you have such requirements.
