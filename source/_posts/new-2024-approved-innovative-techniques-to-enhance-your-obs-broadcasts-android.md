## Innovative Techniques to Enhance Your OBS Broadcasts (Android)

A thorough, well-rounded video content strategy comprises more than only the pre-recorded material that takes hours of planning, recording, and editing. OBS Studio is a superb broadcasting application that you may employ to record your games and share them in a straightforward, quick, and stream approach. One of the main issues when trying to shoot videos directly on your Android smartphone is that it generates substantial delay especially when you try to capture in real-time. OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) is an application that allows you to record your video games and broadcast yourself over the Internet using sites such as the popular Twitch TV. You don't have a dedicated webcam or costly streaming camera? Whatever your purpose may be, you simply wish to employ your Android mobile phones or tablet computer's built-in camera using Open Broadcaster Software

The fundamental answer is No. Your approach should also feature some high-quality live streaming material, such as live event coverage, business announcements, and conferences. Most streamers use OBS as their choice of streaming software. They find the software convenient and budget-friendly since it is free. To set up Open Broadcaster Software so you may broadcast your games over the Internet, you simply have to get the stream key from your Twitch account, which you can easily achieve from your dashboard. But the point is, is it the finest app for live streaming? Since live streaming is creating more noise today than ever, a lot of us are looking for a trustworthy option for OBS to enhance the beauty of their video in terms of usefulness. You need to download an app that mirrors your phone’s screen to your PC, and then you can window capture the PC component of that program using OBS. There may be an app from the phone manufacturer, and a free open-source screen capture program for Android phones.

## 4\. OneStream Live

OneStream is an above-average voice recorder. It’s mostly for business and academic reasons such as meetings, interviews, notes, lectures, and things like that. It supports MP3 and that makes it suitable for the occasional guitar song or musical notion as well. The application also features Dropbox connectivity, widgets, and a WIFI transfer functionality. The quality is also extremely fantastic, but a lot of it hinges on your device’s microphone as well.

OneStream Live is a relatively popular sound recording and mixing program. It contains a ton of samples, tools, and other music-making features. You may record your music and voice as well. It skews toward electronic music and drum rhythms more than other kinds. However, it should work for most persons who don’t demand anything very advanced. There is a free and premium version. The premium edition has all of the new features.

### Steps to Use OneStream Live
