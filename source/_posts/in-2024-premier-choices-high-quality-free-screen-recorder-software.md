### 10\. Screenr

Screenr is remarkable because it excels in the annotation. Annotating is a hard thing to get right without confusing the user. Screenr manages to do it well, without all of the getting lost, undoing your notes, and having to add them again offline.

**Pros**:

* This is a high-performing platform that is programmed for speed.
* One-click capture and share of annotations.
* A significant focus on document annotations that make it clean-cut and professional.

### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

Lewis is a smart-but-friendly looking free online screen recorder service that is entirely free. Unfortunately, it isn’t compatible with the Microsoft Edge internet browser, which is weird. Programmed to run with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, Bewisse perhaps works best with Apple or Mac OS’s. However, they have a great free screenshot capture feature that doesn’t need a login.

**Pros**:

* You don’t need to set up an account with them, log in, or give away any details.
* There is no installation required to use it.
* It is entirely free to use.

**Cons**:

* It’s a little on the primary side.
* It only works if you have a Firefox or Chrome browser.

### 2. [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/)

Screencast-o-Matic is the first of its kind free online screen recorder. It allows you to record any video playing on your screen and have it uploaded and shared. The video recorded online will have to be of the standard resolution, which could be 640×480 or 800×600 and other standard definitions. As your screen gets recorded, you can use text notes as overlays, which is not very different from how you would do on YouTube to get animations in place.

**Pros**:

* This free online screen recorder can support both screen and webcam recordings.
* It allows the users to share the output on YouTube.
* It also assists in drawing and zooming the video files.
* Many edit tools come with the Pro version to edit and personalize the videos.

**Cons**:

* The free version makes the watermark visible, unlike the Pro version.
* You can only record 15 minutes of recording with the free version.
* Screencast-O-Matic requires Java.
* It can record computer audio but the feature is only for Window running computers.

ScreenToaster is a notch above Screencast-o-Matic. It allows you to record your complete screen or a partial area online freely.

### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

Lewis is a smart-but-friendly looking free online screen recorder service that is entirely free. Unfortunately, it isn’t compatible with the Microsoft Edge internet browser, which is weird. Programmed to run with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, Bewisse perhaps works best with Apple or Mac OS’s. However, they have a great free screenshot capture feature that doesn’t need a login.

**Pros**:

* You don’t need to set up an account with them, log in, or give away any details.
* There is no installation required to use it.
* It is entirely free to use.

**Cons**:

* It’s a little on the primary side.
* It only works if you have a Firefox or Chrome browser.

The slides in presentations often contain just the most important information about the topics presentations cover. They serve as talking points the presenter uses to make an argument or start a discussion, but the implications of different points can be unclear without an in-depth explanation.

[Recording a PowerPoint presentation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a simple solution to this problem, as you can take your audience through each slide without having to leave your home. So, in this article, we will show you how to record a PowerPoint presentation with audio and video.
