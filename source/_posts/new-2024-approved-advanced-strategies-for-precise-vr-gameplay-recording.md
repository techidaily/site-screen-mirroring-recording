When you are playing VR games with your VR headset, it feels more natural to play the game from a gaming console rather than playing from a keyboard. If you use PlayStation 4 as your VR console, you can use the built-in recording option on PS4 to record virtual reality gameplay. Here are the steps you need to follow minutely.
