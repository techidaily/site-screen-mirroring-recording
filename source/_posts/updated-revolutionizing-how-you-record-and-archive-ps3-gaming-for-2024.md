OBS is a popular software in the gaming community through which most gamers live stream their gameplay on Twitch and YouTube. However, the OBS Studio is a great scree recorder and you can record PS3 gameplay easily. However, you will first need to stream your gameplay on your computer screen for OBS Studio to capture. You can use a capture card or a PS3 emulator to stream PS3 gameplay on computer screen. Here are the steps on how to record your gameplay on PS3 with OBS.

Step 1: Launch OBS on your computer. Go to Sources tab, click on “+” button. Select Game Capture from the menu.

Step 5: Open your PS3 gameplay on your computer screen and you will see the game on the OBS window.

Step 6: Click on Start Recording button and start playing on PS3\. The recording will go on in the background.

Step 7: Once you are done, come back to OBS and click on Stop Recording.

## The Bottom Line

Even though PlayStation 3 is not the latest gaming console and there is no built-in screen recorder like PS4 and PS5, you can still record your gameplay and upload on social media and video streaming platforms. The best way is to buy a capture card and use Filmora to record PS3 gameplay flawlessly. You can edit the recorded video and make it more interesting to get positive feedback from online viewers.
