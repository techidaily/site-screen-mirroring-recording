* LINE comes with all the smileys and stickers that you can dream of
* 600 million users on a growing platform
* Group calls up to 200 people

Pros:

* This is the best video call app for iPhone for those that are lazy texters
* The world’s largest online sticker collection
* Access you and your friend’s timeline

Cons:

* If you tried to hold a business meeting using LINE, they would sack you
* Aimed at the very young, we’re not even sure this demographic should have iPhones yet

### 10\. [WeChat](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wechat/id414478124)

WeChat is also aimed at the younger generations, but it is more Gen Z and less under-the-age-of-ten.

* They incorporate a healing kit and health tracking data app

Cons:

* Most definitely not the best business video call chat for iPhone.
