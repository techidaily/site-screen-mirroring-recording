## Part 3 How to Record YouTube Videos on iPhone

Recording YouTube videos on iPhone is the easiest because there is no need for a screen recorder for YouTube videos. This is because iOS 11 or later comes with an inbuilt screen recorder option with which you can record YouTube live stream and any video on YouTube. First, you have to enable screen recording feature on your iPhone. Here are the steps you need to follow.

![iphone screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg)

Step 1: Open Settings app and tap on Control Centre.

Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and from the list, find Screen Recording option and enable it.

Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.

Step 4: Bring up the Control Centre by swiping down or up as per your iPhone model.

Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you will see a red bar on the screen. When you are done, you can stop recording from this red bar or blob as you see on your screen.

## Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android

Unlike iPhone, Android does not come with an inbuilt YouTube screen recorder. That is why you will need to install an external screen recording app to capture YouTube videos. We recommend AZ Screen Recorder to capture YouTube videos instantly. Here are all the steps you need to take.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![az screen recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg)

Step 1: Go to Play Store and install AZ Screen Recorder.

Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and you will see an overlay bar on the screen.

Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.

Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start playing your YouTube video before recording starts.

Step 5: When you are done recording, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder. The recorded video file will be saved directly on Gallery.

## Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online

If you do not want to install any app on your phone or you do not want to install any software on your computer, you can opt for an online video capturing tool. This is useful for those who are not tech-savvy and want to capture YouTube video on the go. We recommend Screen Capture which is a YouTube recorder and screen capturing online tool.

Along with video, it can record audio from speakers as well as microphone. The only drawback is that it puts a watermark on the recorded video. To remove the watermark, you have to purchase a premium plan. Here are the simple steps to record any YouTube video with Screen Capture.

Step 1: Open the web browser on your device.

Step 2: Visit [www.screencapture.com](http://www.screencapture.com) and turn on Sound option.

![screen capture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-capture-recorder-free.jpg)

Step 3: Open a new tab and open YouTube video that you want to capture.

Step 4: Come back to Screen Capture and click on Start Recording option.

Step 5: Select Chrome Tab option and select the tab where you have YouTube video. Click on Share button.

Step 6: When you are done recording, click on Stop Recording. Review the recorded video and click on Download button to save the video on your hard drive.

## Conclusion

Depending on the device you are using, you have to follow the specific method on how to record YouTube videos. For iPhone users, screen recording feature comes inbuilt, and you just need to activate it to capture YouTube video. Android users can use AZ Screen Recorder app. If you are looking for an online tool, Screen Capture is great provided you opt for its premium plan to remove watermark. For Windows PC and Mac, you can use Wondershare Filmora to capture YouTube video and edit it out as required.

## Part 3 How to Record YouTube Videos on iPhone

Recording YouTube videos on iPhone is the easiest because there is no need for a screen recorder for YouTube videos. This is because iOS 11 or later comes with an inbuilt screen recorder option with which you can record YouTube live stream and any video on YouTube. First, you have to enable screen recording feature on your iPhone. Here are the steps you need to follow.

![iphone screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg)

Step 1: Open Settings app and tap on Control Centre.

Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and from the list, find Screen Recording option and enable it.

Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.

Step 4: Bring up the Control Centre by swiping down or up as per your iPhone model.

Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you will see a red bar on the screen. When you are done, you can stop recording from this red bar or blob as you see on your screen.

## Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android

Unlike iPhone, Android does not come with an inbuilt YouTube screen recorder. That is why you will need to install an external screen recording app to capture YouTube videos. We recommend AZ Screen Recorder to capture YouTube videos instantly. Here are all the steps you need to take.

![az screen recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg)

Step 1: Go to Play Store and install AZ Screen Recorder.

Step 2: Launch AZ Screen Recorder and you will see an overlay bar on the screen.

Step 3: Open YouTube app and open the video that you want to record.

Step 4: On AZ Screen Recorder, tap on Record icon. You will get 3 seconds of buffer time to start playing your YouTube video before recording starts.

Step 5: When you are done recording, tap on Stop icon on AZ Screen Recorder. The recorded video file will be saved directly on Gallery.

## Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online

If you do not want to install any app on your phone or you do not want to install any software on your computer, you can opt for an online video capturing tool. This is useful for those who are not tech-savvy and want to capture YouTube video on the go. We recommend Screen Capture which is a YouTube recorder and screen capturing online tool.

Along with video, it can record audio from speakers as well as microphone. The only drawback is that it puts a watermark on the recorded video. To remove the watermark, you have to purchase a premium plan. Here are the simple steps to record any YouTube video with Screen Capture.

Step 1: Open the web browser on your device.

Step 2: Visit [www.screencapture.com](http://www.screencapture.com) and turn on Sound option.

First, you have to enable screen recording feature on your iPhone. Here are the steps you need to follow.

## Part 4 How to Record YouTube Videos on Android

Unlike iPhone, Android does not come with an inbuilt YouTube screen recorder. That is why you will need to install an external screen recording app to capture YouTube videos. We recommend AZ Screen Recorder to capture YouTube videos instantly. Here are all the steps you need to take.

## Part 5 How to Record YouTube Videos Online

If you do not want to install any app on your phone or you do not want to install any software on your computer, you can opt for an online video capturing tool. This is useful for those who are not tech-savvy and want to capture YouTube video on the go. We recommend Screen Capture which is a YouTube recorder and screen capturing online tool.

Along with video, it can record audio from speakers as well as microphone. The only drawback is that it puts a watermark on the recorded video. To remove the watermark, you have to purchase a premium plan. Here are the simple steps to record any YouTube video with Screen Capture.

Step 1: Open the web browser on your device.

Step 2: Visit [www.screencapture.com](http://www.screencapture.com) and turn on Sound option.

Step 5: Select Chrome Tab option and select the tab where you have YouTube video. Click on Share button.

Step 6: When you are done recording, click on Stop Recording. Review the recorded video and click on Download button to save the video on your hard drive.

## Conclusion

For iPhone users, screen recording feature comes inbuilt, and you just need to activate it to capture YouTube video. Android users can use AZ Screen Recorder app. If you are looking for an online tool, Screen Capture is great provided you opt for its premium plan to remove watermark.
