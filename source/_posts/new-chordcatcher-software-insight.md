## Conclusion

The Tunefab screen recorder is one of the best screen recording tools currently. Several options like selecting the recording area, advanced editing, and more make it a powerful recording software. But this also has its fair share of disadvantages. From the **Tunefab screen recorder review**, you can know that this software is only for Mac and Windows. So the best alternative is Wondershare Filmora as it allows you the same options and more.
