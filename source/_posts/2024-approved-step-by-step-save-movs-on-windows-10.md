## Step-by-Step: Save MOVs on Windows 10

MOV is an extremely popular video file format that is commonly used in shooting high-quality videos. MOV file format is developed by Apple, and hence, it is the default video file format on Mac. However, you can play MOV files on Windows PC by installing QuickTime. In fact, you can use Windows Media Player 12 as well as VLC Media Player to play MOV files. But the question arises how to record MOV files on Windows 10.

If you want to capture high resolution and high bitrate video without any compression, you have to opt for MOV instead of MP4\. That is why professional video creators prefer MOV file format over MP4 so that there is no compromise with the quality. In order to record MOV files, you will need a video recorder that supports saving your recorded video in MOV file format. In this article, we will illustrate how to record MOV files in the simplest steps on Windows PC.
