After following the above steps, you will see the Filmora recorder has been launched as shown. You can select different capturing modes for your screen recording using the “Full Screen” options. Moreover, the frame size of your capturing can also be adjusted using custom values for size. Choose microphone input for your video through mic settings and enable/disable system audio anytime in this window. The recording can be started with the circular icon on this window as shown in the figure.

Before starting your recording it's important to have a look at the detailed recording settings. To access those settings just click on the settings icon on the GUI of the recorder as can be seen in the above picture. Once you have clicked on it, you will see a new window of settings as shown.

![set audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-for-mac-2.png)

You can choose the destination folder for your recording from the “Save To” filed in the newly launched window. You can also set frame rates, and the quality of your video and start the recorder timer before starting recording. If you want to record the webcam footage or some other camera module attached to your PC too. All you need to check the Camera field and it will simultaneously record your camera feed too.

Soon as you start capturing your screen recording, you will a timer will start the countdown. Once it's finished, your recording will be started. After some time you think, it's time to finish recording then you don’t have to worry about that too. All you have to do is by clicking the small icon in the top-right icon bar of the desktop screen of your MacBook Air as shown in the picture below attached.

This is how you can record your screen with an amazing recorder that comes with the WonderShare Filmora application on your MacBook Air.
