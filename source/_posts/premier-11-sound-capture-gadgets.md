## Premier 11 Sound Capture Gadgets

Meta: Looking for a way to record any streaming audio and save it on your hard drive? Here are the top 11 best streaming audio recorders.

We often come across certain songs that we want to download and listen to them in repeat without consuming the internet data pack.

Unfortunately, there is no download option available on the audio streaming platforms to retain the awesome music or podcast on your hard drive. That is where a streaming audio recorder comes into the scene.

A streaming audio recorder records whatever you are streaming on your computer. Therefore, you can stream your favorite song or motivational podcast, and the recorder will record streaming audio and let you save the file on your computer.
