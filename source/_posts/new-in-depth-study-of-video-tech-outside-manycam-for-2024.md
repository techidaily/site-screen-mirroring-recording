* The settings for recording video are limited and complicated.
* Too many features and functionalities make the user interface messy.

* The editing option post recording is very limited.

Therefore, it is safe to say that ManyCam as a live streaming platform is good enough but there are many limitations and dissatisfaction as far as ManyCam screen recorder is concerned. If your main objective to record professional-quality videos, ManyCam may not be suitable as there are better alternatives available.
