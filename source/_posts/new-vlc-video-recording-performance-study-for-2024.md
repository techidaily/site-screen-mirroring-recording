Being a professional, you can save a simple 100 dollars by using CamStudio freeware, and it is number one right now. Yet, CamStudio isn't the only competitor on the market, fortunately. Some of the features fell brief in CamStudio. Functions such as reflexing and frame rate optimization. Versatility in video formats and capturing the display in real-time are also not present.
