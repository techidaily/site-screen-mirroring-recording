## Uninterrupted Video with Proper OBS Settings

Nothing could be more annoying while recording or streaming than finding out that the frames are getting dropped by the recording or streaming software you are using. Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.

In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.

## **Part 1\. Why OBS Drops Frames?**

OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.

* Your computer has an unstable internet connection.
* Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.
* Your video output resolution is very high.
* Your video bitrate is very high.
* Your internet upload speed is rather low.
* antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.

## **Part 2\. How To Fix OBS Dropping Frame?**

## Way 3\. Reduce The Video Bitrate

OBS generally does not maintain a specified bitrate. It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.

Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.

Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.

Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.

Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.

Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Go to Start menu and search for Firewall.

Step 2: Open Firewall & Network Protection.

## Way 4\. Change OBS Process Priority

By changing the OBS process priority from Normal to Above Normal, there could be more processing power availability for OBS Studio. It helps in solving the problem of frame drop by driving performance from the system for better encoding and rendering. Here are the steps for changing OBS process priority.

Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.

Step 3: Go to Advanced tab and look for Process Priority.

Step 4: You will have to change it to 'Above Normal' from ‘Normal’.

Step 5: Click Apply followed by Ok button.

## Way 5\. Update Network Driver

Dropped frame rates can happen due to the outdated network adapter driver. For this, it is important to look for the latest version of the driver. With up-to-date drivers, there will be a smooth connection when you are streaming or playing online games. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: From Start menu, search for Device Manager and open it.

Step 2: Find Network Adapters and click on it to expand.

Step 3: Find your LAN card and right-click on it.

Step 4: From the menu, select Update Driver option.

## Way 6\. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus

There can be instances where firewalls can block the port for RTMP. It can interfere with the internet connection leading to dropping frames. Similarly, antivirus software messes with any third-party software and prevents regular operations. You have to temporarily turn off real-time protection as well as the antivirus software. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Go to Start menu and search for Firewall.

Step 2: Open Firewall & Network Protection.

Step 3: Turn off firewall for domain, private and public network temporarily to fix dropping frame issue.

Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.

Step 2: Select Video tab. You will see Base and Output resolution.

Step 3: You have to reduce Output Resolution from the current or default setting.

## Way 3\. Reduce The Video Bitrate

OBS generally does not maintain a specified bitrate. It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.

Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.

Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.

Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.

Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.
