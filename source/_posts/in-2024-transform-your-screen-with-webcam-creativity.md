#### 3. Use for Home Surveillance

Everyone wants additional security in the living premises and public places as well. It is the need of the hour, but homeowners are not always able to spend a huge amount on installing advanced security cameras. The great news for you all is that even the basic webcams can meet your surveillance related desires with ease. They work perfectly with the latest motion detection software and can activate sensor-based monitoring 24x7\. The surprising fact is that these webcams can even record infrared light movements that are otherwise invisible to human eyes. Hence, they are the best solution for night time monitoring.

The busy parents these days can use webcams to create homemade baby camera unit using an old laptop, webcam, and Skype-like software tools. It can provide you continuous monitoring of all activities of your child, and you can assist him instantly whenever he needs you

Similarly, webcams can also be used for pet monitoring. Simply download Yawcam or any other software tool and set up your monitoring system in the area where pets keep on playing most of the time. You can have a close view of their all movements and can ensure perfect safety for them.

#### 4. [Play Interactive Video Games](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are a crazy game lover than it is high time to know that webcams can create exciting gaming experience for you with latest interactive game controlling technology. You will be happy to hear that internet is loaded with so many impressive games that are played with sensor-based controls.

You not even need to spend on expensive consoles, these webcams can be fixed to existing laptops and desktop computers to enjoy realistic gaming experience online. Some of the most popular games in this category are WebCam Mania, Human Pong, and Dodgeball, etc.

Software that supports hand gesture-based movements to perform virtual actions is CamSpace and Flutter etc. Many people are using Flutter to control various function on Netflix, Grooveshark, Pandora and YouTube as well.

#### 5. Login or Unlock Computer
