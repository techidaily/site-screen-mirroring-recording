## Part 5: How to Record Teams Meeting Secretly?

Although Microsoft made Teams quite transparent by sending notifications to all the attendees as soon as you start recording a meeting, sometimes you may not want this to happen. In such a case, you must rely on a third-party app that can record your computer screen behind the scenes.

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

With that said, the steps that are given below teach **how to record Teams meeting secretly** with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Get to the Wondershare Screen Recorder Panel**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here for illustration), click the **Record** menu from the top of the **Media** window, and click **Record PC Screen** from the menu that comes down.

![Record  Teams meeting video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-teams-meeting-wondershare-filmora.jpg)

**Step 3: Start Recording Teams Meeting Secretly**

After the recording preferences are set, click the **Record** button to start the screen recording. After this, use the method explained earlier to join or start a new Microsoft Teams meeting.
