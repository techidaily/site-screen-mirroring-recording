Kitkat was updated with screen recording feature, but that was not able to gain much popularity due to need to use Android SDK. But now, Samsung has provided the ultimate solution to all gamers with its build in screen recording feature that works perfectly on S7, S7 Edge, and later phones. This feature is now added as a part of operating system, so it works independently to assist players with easy game recording and sharing needs.
