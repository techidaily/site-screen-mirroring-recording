Audacity is a free and open-source application. It is quite advanced in its features even though it is completely free to download and use. That is why not just beginners but professionals prefer it over other premium audio recorders and editors. However, Audacity is slightly complicated to operate. In this article, we will illustrate how to use Audacity on Mac and recommend a better alternative.

## 1\. How to download and install Audacity on Mac?
