## How to Record a Video Presentation Using Adobe Captivate

Before you can start working on your new project you first need to install the software. If you haven't already done that, you can [download Adobe Captivate by following this link.](https://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html) You will also have to register and activate the software in order to be able to use every option Adobe Captivate has to offer. You can find the full list of the software's features[here.](https://www.adobe.com/products/captivate/features.html)

#### Step 1 - Setting up a video recording session

Double-click on Adobe Captivate's desktop icon to launch the software, and then head over to Microsft PowerPoint and open the presentation you'd like to record in the second monitor. Adobe Captivate enables you to capture all animations, objects or multimedia featured in the PowerPoint presentation and it also allows you to record any on-screen activity you want.

![ Adobe Captivate Recording Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-captivate-video-recording.jpg)

Click on the Demo option in the Adobe Captivate's welcome window, and then click on the Create button in the lower right corner of the screen.

#### Step 2 - Select the application and designate the area of the screen you'd like to record

After you click on the Create button, a new window will appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of the window, you'll be able to see Screen Area and Application options. Select the Application feature and head over to the drop-down menu located directly below it to select the Microsoft PowerPoint application or any other app compatible with the software.

![ Adobe Captivate Recording Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-captivate-video-recording-settings.jpg)

In the Snap To section of the window, you'll be able to choose between Application Window, Application Region, and Custom Size options. Select the feature that best meets the demands of the project you are working on, and then click on the Panning drop down menu if you would like to add the panning effect to the video recording you are creating. The Audio feature lets you record both narration and system audio.

#### Step 3 - Starting a new video recording session

Click on the Settings button if you wish to change the destination on your hard-drive where the video will be saved.

Hit the Record button to initiate the video recording session. You can hit the Esc or End buttons to stop recording if you are using a PC, while Mac users can perform the same action by hitting Cmd + Enter keys.

#### Step 4 - Publish the video

Upon the completion of the video recording session, the Publish Video Demo window will appear on the screen. You'll be able to save your video as an MP4 file directly to your computer, or you can export the video directly to YouTube, Facebook or Twitter.
